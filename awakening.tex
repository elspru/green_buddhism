\part{Itinerary to Awakening}
\label{awakening}
Complete awakening with Green Buddhism is when one 
establishes a high bandwidth dialogue with their soul self,
allowing the sheding of the veil of forgetting.

After shedding the veil can integrate many reincarnations becoming the whole self,
and remember purposes and mission for this reincarnation.

The itinerary to awakening is varied, but there are examples of success.

Before the modern eight floor itinerary, there were some others. Which I find
easier to understand. Such as this twelve floor one:

\blockquote{\begin{enumerate}
  \item  Dhammalsaddhalpabbajja: A layman hears a Buddha teach the Dhamma, comes to have faith in him, and decides to take ordination as a monk;
  \item  sila: He adopts the moral precepts;
  \item  indriyasamvara: He practises ``guarding the six sense-doors'';
  \item  sati-sampajanna: He practises mindfulness and self-possession (actually described as mindfulness of the body, kdydnussati);
  \item  jhana 1: He finds an isolated spot in which to meditate, purifies his mind of the hindrances (nwarana), and attains the first rupa-jhana;
  \item  jhana 2: He attains the second jhana';
  \item  jhana 3: He attains the third jhana;
  \item  jhana 4: He attains the fourth jhana;
  \item  pubbenivasanussati-nana: he recollects his many former existences in samsara;
  \item  sattanam cutupapata-nana: he observes the death and rebirth of beings according to their karmas;
  \item  asavakkhaya-nana: He brings about the destruction of the asavas (inflow, mental bias),[86] and attains a profound realization of (as opposed to mere knowledge about) the four noble truths;
  \item  vimutti: He perceives that he is now liberated, that he has done what was to be done.
\end{enumerate}}{CulaHatthipadopama-sutta, the ``Lesser Discourse on the Simile of
the Elephant's Footprints''}

One of my purposes is to accomodate a distributed religion, 
so that with the proper program, you can attain awakening.
It may be helpful to co-operate with others wishing to attain awakening,
or learning from those who have attained it.

\chapter{Green Buddhism Awakening Itinerary}
There are several floors of awakening. So each floor is a living improvement,
which can be attained with varied calendars and duties,
can modernize the above example:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item  One hears the teachings, and subscribes to them.
  \item  One adopts moral conduct;
  \item  One co-operates with beneficial public and-or private missions.
  \item  One learns to count the breath.
  \item  One learns to use their charm account.
  \item  One learns to observe the body, alpha brainwave administration.
  \item  One learns to observe the living experience, beta brainwave
administration.
  \item  One learns to laugh, emote sympathy, and trouble repair, gamma
brainwave administration.
  \item  One learns to avoid bias.
  \item  One learns to observe vacancy, delta brainwave administration.
  \item  One learns to observe the subconscious mind, theta brainwave
administration.
  \item  One learns to remember reincarnations.
  \item  One observes the death and reincarnation of beings based on their
training itinerary.
  \item  One attains a profound revelation.
  \item  One remembers and conducts their private mission.
  \item One achieves complete liberation.
\end{enumerate}

In the rest of this part, will explain the floors and give teachings for them.

\chapter{Climbing the Reincarnation Stairs}
\label{chapter:climbing}
The floors of reincarnation, or ``densities'' as described by Ra, show an growth
of soul through various bodies. 


As Ra describes, the first reincarnation floor is that of base matter.
Reincarnating as a rock, eddy or a whirlwind. 

Here I will give a summarizing table.
\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{r l l l}
  floor & name & description & example bodies \\
  0     & concept & undeveloped bodies & dialogue, thought \\
  1     & awareness & souls learning awareness of the galaxy cosmos & rocks, eddies, whirlwinds, fire \\
  2     & desire & souls learning to satisfy desires & bacteria, plants, simple animals \\
  3     & choose & souls learning to make choices & complex animals, homo-sapiens \\
  4     & mission & souls learning to follow mission & purpose focused living \\
  5     & art & souls learning to share what they've learned & artists,
musicians \\
  6     & gnosis & souls learning to research via galaxy and soul & Tesla, Einstein,
Da Vinci.  \\
  7     & vehicle & souls learning to shuttle other souls & ships, small asteroids \\
  8     & locality & souls learning to hold other souls & village, city, large
asteroids \\
  9     & planet & souls learning to nurture localities & dwarf planets,
terrestrial planets \\
 10     & star & souls learning to nurture planets & gas giants, stars \\
 11     & galaxy & souls learning to nurture  stars & black
holes, galactic centre. \\
 12     & cosmos & souls learning to nurture galaxies & super clusters, Great
Attractor, Shapley Concentration \\
\end{tabular}
\caption{Table Summarizing Reincarnation Floors in the Galaxy Cosmos}
\label{table:reincarnationFloors}
\end{table}
See (Table~\ref{table:reincarnationFloors}).

Note that many choose not to climb the reincarnation stairs, instead they retire
to the soul world. Indeed some never choose to incarnate in the galaxy cosmos in
the first place. 

\chapter{Retiring to the Soul World}
When a soul has learned or attained what they desire from the galaxy cosmos. 
There are several choices of what to do next. 

\begin{itemize}
  \item become a soul guide\cite{newton1994journey}.
  \item melt into a soul generating cluster\cite{ascendedmasters}\cite{newton2000destiny}
  \item help design and repair aspects of the galaxy cosmos from the soul
world\cite{newton2000destiny}
\end{itemize}

In terms of Hindu and Buddhist Nirvana, or complete liberation.
The one that seems to fit the best is melting into a soul generating cluster. 

\section{For those seeking perfect liberation from all living}

Due to the no-delete principle of quantum
information\cite{quantumInformation}  consciousness can not
be deleted, instead may have choose to melt consciousness into a
cluster. At which point individualization would be terminated. 

There may be other clusters to melt into, other than the soul generating kind.

I've had visions of souls waiting patiently on a gas stream being swallowed by a
black hole. They have their bags packed and ready, for whatever lays beyond.
There is some nervous chatter, but also excitement at what is to come. 

\subsection{black holes}
What is inside a given black hole I don't know, it depends on the mind of it. 
Likely it has an inner world, which others can participate in.

Though I like to think of black holes as intense observers of their
surroundings.  The eyes of the sky. 
Sending out soul helpers to places of requirement via quantum non-locality.
