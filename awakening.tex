\part{Itinerary to Awakening}
\label{awakening}

Complete Awakening with Green Buddhism is when one 
establishes a high bandwidth dialogue with their soul self,
allowing the sheding of the veil of forgetting.

After shedding the veil can integrate many reincarnations becoming the whole self,
and remember purposes and mission for this reincarnation.

The itinerary to awakening is varied, but there are examples of success.

Before the modern eight floor itinerary, there were some others. Which I find
easier to understand. Such as this twelve floor one:

\blockquote{\begin{enumerate}
  \item  Dhammalsaddhalpabbajja: A layman hears a Buddha teach the Dhamma, comes to have faith in him, and decides to take ordination as a monk;
  \item  sila: He adopts the moral precepts;
  \item  indriyasamvara: He practises ``guarding the six sense-doors'';
  \item  sati-sampajanna: He practises mindfulness and self-possession (actually described as mindfulness of the body, kdydnussati);
  \item  jhana 1: He finds an isolated spot in which to meditate, purifies his mind of the hindrances (nwarana), and attains the first rupa-jhana;
  \item  jhana 2: He attains the second jhana';
  \item  jhana 3: He attains the third jhana;
  \item  jhana 4: He attains the fourth jhana;
  \item  pubbenivasanussati-nana: he recollects his many former existences in samsara;
  \item  sattanam cutupapata-nana: he observes the death and rebirth of beings according to their karmas;
  \item  asavakkhaya-nana: He brings about the destruction of the asavas (inflow, mental bias),[86] and attains a profound realization of (as opposed to mere knowledge about) the four noble truths;
  \item  vimutti: He perceives that he is now liberated, that he has done what was to be done.
\end{enumerate}}{CulaHatthipadopama-sutta, the ``Lesser Discourse on the Simile of
the Elephant's Footprints''}

One of my purposes is to accomodate a distributed religion, 
so that with the proper program, you can attain awakening.
It may be helpful to co-operate with others wishing to attain awakening,
or learning from those who have attained it.

\chapter{What is awakening?}
There are several floors of awakening. So each floor is a living improvement,
which can be attained with varied calendars and duties,
can modernize the above example:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item  One hears the teachings, and subscribes to them.
  \item  One adopts moral conduct;
  \item  One co-operates with beneficial public and-or private missions.
  \item  One learns to count the breath.
  \item  One learns to use their charm account.
  \item  One learns to observe the body, alpha brainwave administration.
  \item  One learns to observe the living experience, beta brainwave
administration.
  \item  One learns to laugh, emote sympathy, and trouble repair, gamma
brainwave administration.
  \item  One learns to avoid bias.
  \item  One learns to observe vacancy, delta brainwave administration.
  \item  One learns to observe the subconscious mind, theta brainwave
administration.
  \item  One learns to remember reincarnations.
  \item  One observes the death and reincarnation of beings based on their
training itinerary.
  \item  One attains a profound revelation.
  \item  One remembers their private mission.
  \item  One conducts their private mission.
\end{enumerate}

In the rest of this part, will explain the floors and give teachings for them.
