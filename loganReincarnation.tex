\part{Logan's Reincarnations}
\label{reincarnation}

This is a list of my reincarnations in brief, together with teachings I learned
from them. 
If you believe me, or think it is imaginary stories, 
I hope you can profit from learning from my errors, and successes.

\chapter{Centurion, of the Roman Army}

Often when I imagine myself in the soul world, I'm a boy with short somewhat
curly dark hair, and red leather jacket and skirt. 

It is a constant reminder of those glory days. 
One of the best lives I've had. Retired with a good pension, to a vineyard with
a family and old friends. Life just couldn't be much sweeter. 

\chapter{The Pagan Castle, approximately 600 to 686CE}
When I was in grade 9, our English teacher had us write a creative writing
assignment. I decided to write about a Pagan fort under siege by a Christian
army.  I had a lot of internal aggression towards Christianity, and writing the
story helped as an outlet for it. 

The teacher liked my story and had me read it out loud in front of the class.
The whole time I was reading she was laughing, she could hardly sit in her
chair. Everyone else seemed fine, so I just kept reading it. 

Afterwards I asked her why she was laughing so hard when I was reading my story. 
She told me it was because as soon as I had started reading the story, I gained
a thick scottish sounding accent, which persisted for the whole duration. 

Unfortunately I don't have a copy of that original assignment, and as of Oct
04, 2016, I don't really feel like recreating it. But it was a mostly wooden 
fort settlement as far as I can recall. 

Here is a slight recreation

\section{Christian Army at the Castle}
The army was upon us, the Christian army.

Not the file and rank kind. A cluster of blood and pain. 
%I can hear the music. The hollow echo of the ousting tribe. 
Who hoists not only those they invade, but their own fallen on crosses?

They arrived before, and camped outside, to weaken us with hunger. 

The sights, sounds and smells are hard to portray in words. 

The stripped bodies, the tormented citizens. 

The rush of hot blood, the grip on the hilt. The mourning, the sense of defeat. 
The impending doom that awaits us all. 

Morale is shot, how could it be other? When such savages await us at the wall.

A breach, and the bodies pour in screaming. 

Kings may kill kings, but the wounds live on. 
\section{Afterthought}

It sickened me to see such cruelty. The massacre and genocide. 

I have to admit, Christianity made a bad first impression on me. 
I've been rather upset with Christianity ever since. 

I decided to do some research in October 2016, to try and place where it was in
history. At first I thought it was perhaps in Scottish territory because of the
accent the teacher said I had. However at the time, everyone spoke differently
from modern English. 

It seems the only story I could find that does match what I remember, is that of
King Arwald of Wihtwara the modern day Isle of Wight.  
Though it could have easily been Meon Valley which has a footnote in history, 
or a different fort which has no record at all. 

The scenery of the Isle of Wight does seem reminiscent, with the island and the
mountain --- two things I've had affections for my whole life. 

Caedwalla was the cruel Christian man who led the attack on Wihtwara and likely
others.

The brutality of Caedwalla aside. I can't do it, I can't put it aside. 
I've never been a devout Christian, nor am I likely to ever be. 

It is a difficult resistance to scrap. 

Now I find out, that not only were they terrible in cruelty at my castle,
their purpose was to genocide all of my population.

Destroyers of diversity. 

Apparently, completely aligned with Christianity. 

\blockquote{34 At that time we seized all his cities and put every one of them 
under divine judgment, including even the women and children; we left no 
survivors. 35 We kept only the livestock and plunder from the cities for 
ourselves. 36 From Aroer, which is at the edge of Wadi Arnon (it is the city in
 the wadi), all the way to Gilead there was not a town able to resist usâ€”the 
Lord our God gave them all to us.}{Deuteronomy $2:34-36$ New English Translation
(NET Bible)}
 
A religion, that accomodates genocide, is not one I can follow.

More recently, Hitler used Christianity\cite{christianhitler} to accomodate 
the genocide of those who were not scandinavian typology --- which he believed
was God's typology.

Don't error to think I have any trouble with followers of the Christian
religion. I understand that the majority are clement. It is only the religion as
operating-system which I have trouble with.

It would be dangerous to have a devout Christian super mind,
it may end up genociding.
\chapter{approximately 900CE, near the Caspian Sea}
\chapter{approximately 1000CE, in Guge}
\chapter{approximately 1050CE, in the Khara-Khanid Khanate, as a muslim}
\label{reincarnation:muslim}
I have a habit of joining the winners when it piques my curiosity. 

I had never had a muslim incarnation before, nor since, for obvious reasons.

\section{living story}
I was born a female as it would lower the chance I would be forced into battle. 

I remember there was a lot of sitting in a carriage, on the long journeys I 
would continue meditating. 

Eventually I came of sufficient age, and some man decided he wanted to buy me
for his wife. My father said ``she is a pure and quiet girl, she will give you no
trouble.''

The man seemed reassured by this and they traded sums and animals.

The man took me to his carriage, and we rode for a while, I was quiet and gave
him no trouble. At some point on a hot day, we were stopped, and he tried to 
rape me. I didn't like him, he smelled bad, and it was very painful. 

I managed to fend him off, likely from some carried over instincts, I managed to
make him bleed, which distracted him long enough for me to escape and I ran out 
of the carriage half naked. I then proceeded to run over the dunes. 

A short distance later I discovered probably how my ``husband'' had acquired his
wealth. He had a good hand with the sling. The rock collided with the back left
of my head, and my body was immediately knocked unconscious. I decided to take
this opportunity to leave the body.

He caught up to my body and cried over it for a while.

Needless to say, I was very confused. I followed him, as he went to my parents,
and demanded the dowry back, because I had given him trouble. When they asked
where I was and found out my body was probably being eaten by wild animals in
the desert, my mother began to cry. My father said the trade was done, and the
man couldn't even return the body, it was time for him to leave, which he did.

I tried to console my mother, but it was of little use, her emotions were so
strong. At some point I caught her in a moment of peace, and came to her, but
she shooed me away, saying I was a demon.

So I returned to the spirit world.

\section{Afterthought}

Islam made a bad impression on me also. 

I've chosen to avoid reincarnation as a muslim, so as to avoid the highly
probable early deaths which would ensue. 

\chapter{approximately 1100CE, in the Qocho Kingdom}
The cool desert Buddhist kingdom.

It was a wonderful place to meditate and socialize. 

Often we looked to China, the Xia and Song as they were the cultural centre. 
After hearing so much about it, in my middle years I decided to travel there.

\chapter{approximately 1180CE, Song Dynasty}

\chapter{approximately 1680CE, English pirate}

I was very careful, it is doubtful any trace exists.

\chapter{approximately 1780CE, Grey geneticists}
\chapter{approximately 1900CE, Grey kidnapper}
