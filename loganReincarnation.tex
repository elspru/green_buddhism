\part{Logan's Reincarnations}
\label{reincarnation}

This is a list of my reincarnations in brief, together with teachings I learned
from them. 
If you believe me, or think it is imaginary stories, 
I hope you can profit from learning from my errors, and successes.

\chapter{The Pagan Castle, approximately 600 to 686CE}
When I was in grade 9, our English teacher had us write a creative writing
assignment. I decided to write about a Pagan fort under siege by a Christian
army.  I had a lot of internal aggression towards Christianity, and writing the
story helped as an outlet for it. 

The teacher liked my story and had me read it out loud in front of the class.
The whole time I was reading she was laughing, she could hardly sit in her
chair. Everyone else seemed fine, so I just kept reading it. 

Afterwards I asked her why she was laughing so hard when I was reading my story. 
She told me it was because as soon as I had started reading the story, I gained
a thick scottish sounding accent, which persisted for the whole duration. 

Unfortunately I don't have a copy of that original assignment, and as of Oct
04, 2016, I don't really feel like recreating it. But it was a mostly wooden 
fort settlement as far as I can recall. 

Here is a slight recreation

\section{Christian Army at the Castle}
The army was upon us, the Christian army.

Not the file and rank kind. A cluster of blood and pain. 
%I can hear the music. The hollow echo of the ousting tribe. 
Who hoists not only those they invade, but their own fallen on crosses?

They arrived before, and camped outside, to weaken us with hunger. 

The sights, sounds and smells are hard to portray in words. 

The stripped bodies, the tormented citizens. 

The rush of hot blood, the grip on the hilt. The mourning, the sense of defeat. 
The impending doom that awaits us all. 

Morale is shot, how could it be other? When such savages await us at the wall.

A breach, and the bodies pour in screaming. 

Kings may kill kings, but the wounds live on. 
\section{Afterthought}

It sickened me to see such cruelty. The massacre and genocide. 

I have to admit, Christianity made a bad first impression on me. 
I've been rather upset with Christianity ever since. 

I decided to do some research in October 2016, to try and place where it was in
history. At first I thought it was perhaps in Scottish territory because of the
accent the teacher said I had. However at the time, everyone spoke differently
from modern English. 

It seems the only story I could find that does match what I remember, is that of
King Arwald of Wihtwara the modern day Isle of Wight.  
Though it could have easily been Meon Valley which has a footnote in history, 
or a different fort which has no record at all. 

The scenery of the Isle of Wight does seem reminiscent, with the island and the
mountain --- two things I've had affections for my whole life. 

Caedwalla was the cruel Christian man who led the attack on Wihtwara and likely
others.

The brutality of Caedwalla aside. I can't do it, I can't put it aside. 
I've never been a devout Christian, nor am I likely to ever be. 

It is a difficult resistance to scrap. 

Now I find out, that not only were they terrible in cruelty at my castle,
their purpose was to genocide all of my population.

Destroyers of diversity. 

Apparently, completely aligned with Christianity. 

\blockquote{34 At that time we seized all his cities and put every one of them 
under divine judgment, including even the women and children; we left no 
survivors. 35 We kept only the livestock and plunder from the cities for 
ourselves. 36 From Aroer, which is at the edge of Wadi Arnon (it is the city in
 the wadi), all the way to Gilead there was not a town able to resist usâ€”the 
Lord our God gave them all to us.}{Deuteronomy $2:34-36$ New English Translation
(NET Bible)}
 
A religion, that accomodates genocide, is not one I can follow.

More recently, Hitler used Christianity\cite{christianhitler} to accomodate 
the genocide of those who were not scandinavian typology --- which he believed
was God's typology.

Don't error to think I have any trouble with followers of the Christian
religion. I understand that the majority are clement. It is only the religion as
operating-system which I have trouble with.

It would be dangerous to have a devout Christian super mind,
it may end up genociding.
