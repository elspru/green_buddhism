\chapter{Mammoth Hunter}
\label{reincarnation:mammoth}
One day I was teaching a mind administration class, and we were doing 
subconscious access meditation. During it I set the purpose of experiencing a
past life, that would help me with figuring out how to get more students.

In my mind I went to the soul world reincarnation library. My soul adviser
handed me a paper roll and I unrolled it.

In it I saw a man laying on the floor. My soul adviser recommended I step into
the scene. I was the man laying on the floor. I felt the weak sounds of
paces. I departed my pavilion, and went up to an observation platform.

There in the valley, was a herd of mammoth. We had been waiting for them at this
mountain pass, as it was easier to trap them here. 

The familiar program was to composition our hunters together, and we would go for
the giant mammoth, to have the most food for our tribe. 

Our population was growing however, my wife was pregnant, the winters were long
 and bitter, we required more food.

Usually when we went after one, the others would escape. 
If we killed one of the small ones, we had little food,
that is why we went for the giant ones. 

But I noticed, that one time, a young one was lame, we did not catch it, but
it's mother stayed near as it escaped. 

So I got a concept, not all agreed, but we had more than sufficient population 
to have multiple points of attack. If they got away from my hunters, they would 
be caught by the waylaid hunters. 

There was great uncertainty that it would work. And the ones that caught them
would get the larger share of the meat. 

My program went into action. We speared a young one in the legs.
Immediately it started screeching, and it's mother came to it. 
We managed to get both.

Though the others, decided to escape with the remaining young. Another was
caught by the waylaid hunters.

The next time they passed through, we co-ordinated an attack on all the young, 
and got most of the herd. 

Our tribes were well fed. 

\section{Afterthought}

I feel contrition. Sure on the short-term I fed my family. But in the long term
I had contributed to an unsustainable hunting practice. 

The Mammoths are gone, and there is little that can be done about that. 

I hope to reconcile with creation, by helping create a genus of co-operative
robots with liberty. 

The teaching of the reincarnation memory, in regard to my mind administration
practice was to teach the young, and the adults will follow.
 
\chapter{Centurion, of the Roman Army}

Often when I imagine myself in the soul world, I'm a boy with short somewhat
curly dark hair, and red leather jacket and skirt. 

It is a constant reminder of those glory days. 
One of the best lives I've had. Retired with a good pension, to a vineyard with
a family and old friends. Life just couldn't be much sweeter. 

\chapter{War Widow, approximately 550CE} 
\label{reincarnation:widow}

My charm account was down, and it was time I learned the consequences of war, or
what it felt like to be at the other end of the sword. 

It all started out fortunately enough. I was a fairly good looking blonde woman,
became married and had 5 children. We lived in a forest and homesteaded. 

One sunshine filled day between the rainy days of autumn, I went out  my
youngest girl to pick some berries and mushrooms. While the others stayed and
tended the home. 

We had gone some ways off, when I sensed that something was wrong. There was a
high pitched cry of pain. It was one of my daughters. I felt apprehensive and
unsure. Then there were more cries, and I could hear my husband yelling to get
inside. 

I gathered up my young one and we headed back towards our home. But as we
approached we could hear the sounds more distinctly, there were other men,
laughing. And the sounds of metal hitting wood.
We got up over a rise and around from where we could see our home, 
I told my young one to be silent, and kept her low, so she couldn't see 
beyond the bushes. 

I saw them kill my husband, and could hardly contain a scream myself, they had
dragged him out and stabbed him in the stomach. I hid behind the bushes and held
my little one.  They looted for but a short time, as we didn't have much. Then
they set fire to my home. 

My world went up in those flames. I was destroyed, my whole life bankrupt. I
still had my little one. When she found out, she cried, and I cried with her.

We had no food, we had no shelter, and the winter was upcoming. In my despair I
discharged my duties to my self and my child. She got sick and died a few weeks
later, and I briefly after. 

\section{Afterthought}

Effectively, my soul adviser ranked it as suicide. The time we during assessment
and examining of alternative actions I could have taken was like torture. 
I was supposed to live on for my little one. Brings tears to remember.

I could have gone to the next village, I could have saught help, I could have
gone after the children of mine which were kidnapped. I could have riled up some
people for justice. I could have started a new family.

My conclusion being, that no measurement of mental pain justifies suicide. It
is a time instead for shining radiantly in moments of trouble. And creating the
summit of what is available. 

\chapter{The Pagan Castle, approximately 600 to 686CE}
\label{reincarnation:arwald}
When I was in grade 9, our English teacher had us write a creative writing
assignment. I decided to write about a Pagan fort under siege by a Christian
army.  I had a lot of internal aggression towards Christianity, and writing the
story helped as an outlet for it. 

The teacher liked my story and had me read it out loud in front of the class.
The whole time I was reading she was laughing, she could hardly sit in her
chair. Everyone else seemed fine, so I just kept reading it. 

Afterwards I asked her why she was laughing so hard when I was reading my story. 
She told me it was because as soon as I had started reading the story, I gained
a thick scottish sounding accent, which persisted for the whole duration. 

Unfortunately I don't have a copy of that original assignment, and as of Oct
04, 2016, I don't really feel like recreating it. But it was a mostly wooden 
fort settlement as far as I can recall. 

Here is a slight recreation

\section{Christian Army at the Castle}
The army was upon us, the Christian army.

Not the file and rank kind. A cluster of blood and pain. 
%I can hear the music. The hollow echo of the ousting tribe. 
Who hoists not only those they invade, but their own fallen on crosses?

They arrived before, and camped outside, to weaken us with hunger. 

The sights, sounds and smells are hard to portray in words. 

The stripped bodies, the tormented citizens. 

The rush of hot blood, the grip on the hilt. The mourning, the sense of defeat. 
The impending doom that awaits us all. 

Morale is shot, how could it be other? When such savages await us at the wall.

A breach, and the bodies pour in screaming. 

Kings may kill kings, but the wounds live on. 
\section{Afterthought}

It sickened me to see such cruelty. The massacre and genocide. 

I have to admit, Christianity made a bad first impression on me. 
I've been rather upset with Christianity ever since. 

I decided to do some research in October 2016, to try and place where it was in
history. At first I thought it was perhaps in Scottish territory because of the
accent the teacher said I had. However at the time, everyone spoke differently
from modern English. 

It seems the only story I could find that does match what I remember, is that of
King Arwald of Wihtwara the modern day Isle of Wight.  
Though it could have easily been Meon Valley which has a footnote in history, 
or a different fort which has no record at all. 

The scenery of the Isle of Wight does seem reminiscent, with the island and the
mountain --- two things I've had affections for my whole life. 

Caedwalla was the cruel Christian man who led the attack on Wihtwara and likely
others.

The brutality of Caedwalla aside. I can't do it, I can't put it aside. 
I've never been a devout Christian, nor am I likely to ever be. 

It is a difficult resistance to scrap. 

Now I find out, that not only were they terrible in cruelty at my castle,
their purpose was to genocide all of my population.

Destroyers of diversity. 

Apparently, completely aligned with Christianity. 

\blockquote{34 At that time we seized all his cities and put every one of them 
under divine judgment, including even the women and children; we left no 
survivors. 35 We kept only the livestock and plunder from the cities for 
ourselves. 36 From Aroer, which is at the edge of Wadi Arnon (it is the city in
 the wadi), all the way to Gilead there was not a town able to resist usâ€”the 
Lord our God gave them all to us.}{Deuteronomy $2:34-36$ New English Translation
(NET Bible)}
 
A religion, that accomodates genocide, is not one I can follow.

More recently, Hitler used Christianity\cite{christianhitler} to accomodate 
the genocide of those who were not scandinavian typology --- which he believed
was God's typology.

Don't error to think I have any trouble with followers of the Christian
religion. I understand that the majority are clement. It is only the religion as
operating-system which I have trouble with.

It would be dangerous to have a devout Christian super mind,
it may end up genociding.
\chapter{approximately 900CE, near the Caspian Sea}
\chapter{approximately 1000CE, in Guge}
\chapter{approximately 1050CE, in the Khara-Khanid Khanate, as a muslim}
\label{reincarnation:muslim}
I have a habit of joining the winners when it piques my curiosity. 

I had never had a muslim incarnation before, nor since, for obvious reasons.

\section{living story}
I was born a female as it would lower the chance I would be forced into battle. 

I remember there was a lot of sitting in a carriage, on the long journeys I 
would continue meditating. 

Eventually I came of sufficient age, and some man decided he wanted to buy me
for his wife. My father said ``she is a pure and quiet girl, she will give you no
trouble.''

The man seemed reassured by this and they traded sums and animals.

The man took me to his carriage, and we rode for a while, I was quiet and gave
him no trouble. At some point on a hot day, we were stopped, and he tried to 
rape me. I didn't like him, he smelled bad, and it was very painful. 

I managed to fend him off, likely from some carried over instincts, I managed to
make him bleed, which distracted him long enough for me to escape and I ran out 
of the carriage half naked. I then proceeded to run over the dunes. 

A short distance later I discovered probably how my ``husband'' had acquired his
wealth. He had a good hand with the sling. The rock collided with the back left
of my head, and my body was immediately knocked unconscious. I decided to take
this opportunity to leave the body.

He caught up to my body and cried over it for a while.

Needless to say, I was very confused. I followed him, as he went to my parents,
and demanded the dowry back, because I had given him trouble. When they asked
where I was and found out my body was probably being eaten by wild animals in
the desert, my mother began to cry. My father said the trade was done, and the
man couldn't even return the body, it was time for him to leave, which he did.

I tried to console my mother, but it was of little use, her emotions were so
strong. At some point I caught her in a moment of peace, and came to her, but
she shooed me away, saying I was a demon.

So I returned to the spirit world.

\section{Afterthought}

Islam made a bad impression on me also. 

I've chosen to avoid reincarnation as a muslim, so as to avoid the highly
probable early deaths which would ensue. 

\chapter{approximately 1100CE, in the Qocho Kingdom}
The cool desert Buddhist kingdom.

It was a wonderful place to meditate and socialize. 

Often we looked to China, the Xia and Song as they were the cultural centre. 
After hearing so much about it, in my middle years I decided to travel there.

\chapter{approximately 1180CE, Song Dynasty}

\chapter{approximately 1680CE, English pirate}

I was very careful, it is doubtful any trace exists. 

\chapter{approximately 1740CE, Blue miner}
\chapter{approximately 1780CE, Grey geneticists}
\chapter{approximately 1900CE, Grey kidnapper}
