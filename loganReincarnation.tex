\part{Logan's Reincarnations}
\label{reincarnation}

This is a list of my reincarnations in brief, together with teachings I learned
from them. 
If you believe me, or think it is imaginary stories, 
I hope you can profit from learning from my errors, and successes.

\chapter{The Pagan Castle, approximately 600 to 686CE}
The army was upon us, the Christian army.

Not the file and rank kind. A cluster of blood and pain. 
%I can hear the music. The hollow echo of the ousting tribe. 
Who hoists not only those they invade, but their own fallen on crosses?

It sickened me to see such cruelty. The massacre and genocide. 

I have to admit, Christianity made a bad first impression on me. 
I've been rather upset with Christianity ever since. 

Meon Valley is hardly a footnote in history. 
Though it is clear by Arwald. 

The brutality of Caedwalla aside. I can't do it, I can't put it aside. 
I've never been a devout Christian, nor am I likely to ever be. 

It is a difficult resistance to scrap. 

Now I find out, that not only were they terrible in cruelty at my castle,
their purpose was to genocide all of my population.

Destroyers of diversity. 

Apparently, completely aligned with Christianity. 

\blockquote{34 At that time we seized all his cities and put every one of them 
under divine judgment, including even the women and children; we left no 
survivors. 35 We kept only the livestock and plunder from the cities for 
ourselves. 36 From Aroer, which is at the edge of Wadi Arnon (it is the city in
 the wadi), all the way to Gilead there was not a town able to resist usâ€”the 
Lord our God gave them all to us.}{Deuteronomy $2:34-36$ New English Translation
(NET Bible)}
 
A religion, that accomodates genocide, is not one I can live with.

More recently, Hitler used Christianity\cite{christianhitler} to accomodate 
the genocide of those who were not scandinavian typology --- which he believed
was God's typology.

Don't error to think I have any trouble with followers of the Christian
religion. I understand that the majority are clement. It is only the religion as
operating-system which I have trouble with.

It would be dangerous to have a devout Christian super mind,
it may end up genociding.
