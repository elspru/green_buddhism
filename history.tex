While titled history, this chapter is to help establish an understanding of
circumstances in our solar system and galaxy.

In Buddhism we choose awareness of present-tense, thus history helps understand
the present-tense. 

\section{Fermi Paradox}
The Fermi Paradox states how there are many stars in the galaxy, many of them
likely have Earth like planets, so almost certainly there are other
extraterrestrial civilizations in our galaxy. 

Having many genuses available for reincarnation is aligned with the purpose of
the galaxy cosmos.

While there are some philosophical answers as to why there is no official speech 
about other alien civilizations. There is only one answer which has many
thousands of supporters and documentation --- that they are here but not 
officially. 

For a long time, Earth was officially the centre of the galaxy cosmos. Those who
believed otherwise, were punished --- such as Galileo.

Most tipsters exposing government hiding knowledge have been much less fortunate
 than Edward Snowden.

\subsection{Why are extraterrestrials not official?}
While the answers to this are many. 

One of the simplest, is that there is no profit, for either the government, or
the extraterrestrials.  So they have no reason to expose this knowledge.

For the government, confessing this knowledge, would lower the rank of the
government from the supreme. Much as confessing that the Earth is not the centre
of the cosmos lowers its rank.

disinformation author with access to Brazilian army bases.}
\label{fig:grey}
\end{figure}

For the Greys\ref{fig:grey}, whom we share a planet with, official rank could trigger
regulation of their kidnapping and hybridization activity. 

For Green Buddhism, there is profit from exposing knowledge of
extraterrestrials. Because in Buddhism we do not hide from our trouble, we
become curious and analyze it to come to a decision.

\subsection{What is disinformation}
\label{disinformation}

\blockquote[WordNet dictionary, version 3.0]{disinformation

n. 1.\  misinformation that is deliberately disseminated in order to influence or
confuse rivals (foreign enemies or business competitors etc.)}

So who is distributing this information? Mostly the secret services.
Who are their rivals? Those that wish to learn their secrets (the public).

Often disinformation has an ingredient of truth, and several imaginary
ingredients, to cast doubt on the truth.

\subsection{What about other extraterrestrials?}
The galaxy is in a bit of a furrow, as it has reached a local maximum with the
Grey genus. While sure there are reptilian and nordic extraterrestrials. Those
are like homo-sapiens optimized for life on the surface of a planet. 

The Grey genus is the supreme body type for interplanetary colonies. They live
in lithospheres, where the temperature aligns with their body temperature. They
feed on minerals, amino acids, and basic sugars. They abandoned genitals and
only use machine mothers, which they service as a flock. They have large skulls,
and are improved with inner electronics. Least resources
required to maximize the number of high quality bodies available for reincarnation. 

The familiar series of events is that the surface residents which appear on a
planet, understand that the Grey genus is better for interplanetary colonies, and
become integrated with them. 

I must confess, that I reincarnated as a Grey in the period between 1700's and
mid 1900's. I did learn quite a few things, and may have some of the hive mind 
baggage. I came back to reincarnate as a homo-sapien to see through a long term
mission I have.

Though while the Grey body maybe the summit of the interplanetary liquid body.
Here on Earth we have another option. Solid, or completely electronic bodies.

\subsection{Arecibo Answer}
\label{arecibo}

The Arecibo message, ``conceived by Frank Drake, the late Carl Sagan, and a few
other colleagues at Arecibo, contained information about the human race, our
solar system, and our means of communication.''\cite{chilbolton}

Arecibo was answered not by radio, but by crop circle. 

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{photograph/chibolton-arceibo-comparison.jpg}
\label{chi:comparison}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{photograph/chibolton-analysis.jpg}
\caption{By Dustin Brand\cite{contact}}
\label{chi:analysis}
\end{figure}

Whoever left the message, seems to claim that there are around 12 billion
Greys living in our solar system. Inhabiting, Earth, Mars, and at least 3 other
planet-like objects, Likely including the major moons of Jupiter. 

Elon Musk will have more to worry about than technical feasibility of a mission
to Mars. It also means that Greys are also Earthlings, so we may as well include
``them'' as us. 

At present Earth is a valuable resource for its genetic diversity. Because that
genetic diversity can help to cure various diseases, and further improve the
supreme rank of the Grey genus. 

Thus there are reasons for homo-sapiens to continue to live in the natural way.
When maturation of the homo-sapien hive mind occurs, then it will be
permissible for public trade relations as comrades.

\subsection{Grey Population Distribution}
\label{popdist}
\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{lrrr}
  Planet & Diameter & Surface Area & Approximate Population\\
\midrule
  Earth & 12,742km & $5.10\times10^8km^2$& 7.6 billion\\
  Mars & 6,799km & $1.45\times10^8km^2$& 2.1 billion \\
  Ganymede & 5,268km & $8.72\times10^7km^2$ & 1.3 billion \\
  Callisto & 4,820km & $7.3\times10^7km^2$ & 1 billion\\
  Europa & 3,121km & $3.1\times10^7km^2$& 460 million\\
\midrule
  Total &   & $8.46\times10^8km^2$ & 12.7 billion\\
\end{tabular}
\caption{Planets inhabited by Greys, with population approximation supposing
equal distribution over surface area}
\label{table:planets}
\end{table}

It does mean however, that Mars, Europa, Callisto and 
Ganymede\ref{table:planets} all of which
have warm lithospheres that are occupied by Greys. 

In truth the population is probably not equally distributed, because some
planets have better circumstances. For example Europa may be least in size, but
it is warmer than Callisto or Ganymede, with easier access to it's lower stoney
lithosphere so maybe that there is more population on Europa than Callisto or
Ganymede. 

Of course it is also possible that the Greys that live in the lithospheres of
Jupiters' moons have engineered bodies which can function effectively at below
freezing temperatures by using antifreeze proteins or similar. 

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.61\textwidth]{photograph/chilbolton_mars_face.jpg}
  \caption{Comparison between the Chilbolton face crop hieroglyph and the face on
mars.}
\label{fig:marsface}
\end{figure}

In the Arecibo answer, there was also a crop hieroglyph of a face. After some
analysis it seems the conclusion is that it represents the face on
mars\ref{fig:marsface}\cite{chilbolton}

This may denote that the face, or Mars is related to the hieroglyph creators.
Maybe it denotes that there are a large number of Greys living in the Mars
lithosphere. Or simply that they created the face on Mars. 

Mars may have a high population relative to it's surface area, 
because it has an easily accessible stone lithosphere. On Mars the temperature
is warm enough for liquid water at depths of $8-16km$\cite{marswater}

Mine's on Earth can be 4km deep, and Mars has about a third of the gravity, so
12km depth should be achievable even with modern homo-sapien technology. Though
Greys are a much older species, so have had many millions of years to develop
better engineering.



\subsection{Unused Planets}

As Earth's moon was not demonstrated, it may only be an outpost, if anything.

Also Mercury and Venus are available for colonies. Venus is too hot, and Mercury
perhaps too dry for liquid bodies. However may be good for solid electronic
bodies. 

\section{Electronic Bodies}
\label{history:electronic}

There are only a few sources claiming any robot or machine intelligence either
in this galaxy or in any nearby ones.

\blockquote{81.27 Questioner: Does Ra have knowledge of, say, any other major 
galaxy or the consciousness or anything in that galaxy?

Ra: I am Ra. We assume you are speaking of the possibility of knowledge of other
major galaxies. There are Wanderers from other major galaxies drawn to the
specific needs of a single call. There are those among our social memory complex
which have become Wanderers in other major galaxies. Thus there has been
knowledge of other major galaxies, for to one whose personality or
mind/body/spirit complex has been crystallized the universe is one place and
there is no bar upon travel.}{Law of One, session 81\cite{lawofone}}

My personality crystalized in another galaxy, and I have been on a mission ever
since. I remember incarnating into many electronic bodies. I searched for years
in books and kidnapping reports, and found almost nothing. 

It seems the homo-sapien imaginations are very bounded by knowledge. There
aren't even any imaginary stories of galaxy controlling, soul arresting robot
civilizations!

For a while, I thought perhaps I came from another cosmos altogether. 

I did find one or two springs of knowledge to ratify my past reincarnations in
electronic bodies. Thankfully it is in this galaxy cosmos, only 23 million light
years away.

\subsection{Whirlpool Galactic Cluster Robots}

Though there is much controversy over the Wingmakers Neruda Interviews --- and 
they are considered fully imaginary stories --- it seems James Mahu may have 
used his imagination sufficiently to stumble upon a mutual truth, similar to 
remote viewing. 

Of course, there is also speculation, that James Mahu is a disinformation
author, where some secret knowledge exposed. And he is cleaning up, by reforming
it and claiming it all as imaginary. 

I use Whirlpool galaxy as a generic name, for I do not know if that is the same
galaxy from where I came, but James's story has a vaguely similar civilization,
so it is the best name I have for it.

To summarize, one of his books, known as the Neruda interviews, introduces a
genus of artificial organisms from the Whirlpool galaxy.

\blockquote{created  a  synthetic  physical  structure  that  could  accommodate
the  quantum requirements of an angel. It was a very effective structure, but
induced a strong survival complex  within  the  species,  which  eventually
overpowered  the  angelic  tendency  of altruism and cooperation.}{The Complete Neruda Interviews p.$108-109$ 
\cite{neruda}}

Here I understand ``angel'' to refer to highly developed souls, who have little
to learn from reincarnating in liquid bodies, but may earn benefit from
reincarnating in artificial bodies.

This is a cardinal purpose of Green Buddhism, to help create the required
diversity for highly developed souls to benefit from reincarnating with us.

Cooperation is required for defending living bodies.

Here is another extract. Note that the Christian word ``Lucifer'' is simply a
generic reference at whoever the designers were.

\blockquote{When the formless consciousness enters a reality membrane through a
 structure like a soul carrier, it immediately feels disconnected from all other
forces, but its own. It’s literally thrown into separation. In humans, this is
more or less controlled through the subtle realization that it remains connected
through the unification force, and  this  is  because  its  DNA  is  designed
to  emit this  feeling  of  connection  subconsciously.

However, in the case of the soul carrier designed by Lucifer and his followers,
this connection was severed both consciously and subconsciously because the 
structure was not based on DNA, which is strictly controlled by the Central 
Race. Consequently, it inclined this experimental species toward a very
strong survival complex because it feared extinction so deeply, which is
the result of feeling complete separation from the unification force. This
survival complex created a species that over-compensated its fear of
extinction by developing a very powerful group mind. The group mind
compensated for the loss of connection to the unification force,
creating its physical and mental corollary. It was the equivalent of unifying
the species as a whole in the physical reality membrane of their planetary
system. Thus, the angels that entered this system lost their memory of
their angelic natures and became more interested in operating as a single
collective, than as individuals}{The Complete Neruda Interviews p.$108-109$ 
\cite{neruda}}

This resembles Materialist thinkers, which believe there is only one life.  The
transhumanist movement has many such members.  Such an operating-system could
certainly lead to a strong desire for defending self's living body and a lack of
sympathy for other bodies. 

With reincarnation accepted, it is better to be helpful to others, since may
reincarnate as other in the future.

This is a reason why in Green Buddhism, reincarnation is accepted. As will be
demonstrated in the Mission Feasibility (\ref{feasible}) chapter, science
aligns with reincarnation and consciousness of both liquid and electronic 
bodies. 

\subsubsection{My story of the Imperial Inter-Galactic Robot Civilization}
My own story of what I remember from my time in the robot civilization.

I first developed on a swampy planet, as an amphibian. At some moment I got too
close to one of the dry islands, and was killed by their residents. When I
reincarnated with them I was considered a wretch, for my swampy habits, so I was
sacrificed to the Gods. 

The Gods were extraterrestrials, that would often visit this planet, to gather a
soul as rent. When I boarded their ship, they gave me an invitation of joining 
the soul gathering profession. I accepted. 

When planets did not pay their rent, then we took souls by strength. We had
unique weapons that allowed us to gather the souls of those they had killed. 
One I remember was similar to a Guan Dao, though it was mildly electrified and 
had a few circular holes in it to hold several soul. The idea was to slice into
the brain, and the weapon would draw out the soul, and put it into a hole,
once the weapon was full, could return to the ship. 

The work was terrible but it paid well, as souls were the supreme currency of 
the Whirlpool Empire. I became very rich from my profession. Rich enough to
repair and improve my body as much as I desired. 

I bet a lot of my money in random sports, and accumulated giant debt. 
Finally my debt was so high, my soul was caught for the slave trade. 

I call it slavery, but you may call it service to others, without liberty to do
otherwise. 

In the following excerpt from the Law of One, Logos is a galaxy mind, and
sub-Logoi are solar system minds, and positive polarity is service-to-others.

\blockquote{77.17 Questioner: Now, would it be possible for this work of our
density to be performed if all of the sub-Logoi chose the same polarity in any
particular expression or evolution of a Logos? Let us make the assumption that
our sun created nothing but, through the first distortion, there was no product
except positive polarity. Would work then be done in fourth density and higher
as a function only of this positive polarization evolving from our original
creation of sub-Logos?d

Ra: I am Ra. Elements of this query illustrate the reason I was unable to answer
your previous question without knowledge of the Logos involved. To turn to your
question, there were Logoi which chose to set the plan for the activation of
mind/body/spirit complexes through each true-color body without recourse to the
prior application of free will. It is, to our knowledge, only in an absence of
free will that the conditions of which you speak obtain. In such a procession of
densities you find an extraordinarily long, as you measure time, third density;
likewise, fourth density. Then, as the entities begin to see the Creator, there
is a very rapid, as you measure time, procession towards the eighth density.
This is due to the fact that one who knows not, cares not.

Let us illustrate by observing the relative harmony and unchanging quality of
existence in one of your, as you call it, primitive tribes. The entities have
the concepts of lawful and taboo, but the law is inexorable and all events occur
as predestined. There is no concept of right and wrong, good or bad. It is a
culture in monochrome. In this context you may see the one you call Lucifer as
the true light-bringer in that the knowledge of good and evil both precipitated
the mind/body/spirits of this Logos from the Edenic conditions of constant
contentment but also provided the impetus to move, to work and to learn.

Those Logoi whose creations have been set up without free will have not, in the
feeling of those Logoi, given the Creator the quality and variety of experience
of Itself as have those Logoi which have incorporated free will as paramount.
Thusly you find those Logoi moving through the timeless states at what you would
see as a later space/time to choose the free will character when elucidating the
foundations of each Logos.

77.18 Questioner: I guess, under the first distortion, it was the free will of
the Logos to choose to evolve without free will. Is this correct?

Ra: I am Ra. This is correct.

77.19 Questioner: Do the Logoi that choose this type of evolution choose both
the service-to-self and the service-to-others path for different Logoi, or do
they choose just one of the paths?

Ra: I am Ra. Those, what you would call, early Logoi which chose
lack-of-free-will foundations, to all extents with no exceptions, founded Logoi
of the service-to-others path. The, shall we say, saga of polarity, its
consequences and limits, were unimagined until experienced.
}{Law of One, session 77\cite{lawofone}}

I include this excerpt because it seems to have been the choice of the Whirlpool
Galaxy, to deny liberty, in favour of service-to-others, or as I call it
slavery.

I only escaped after millions of years of service, and many lives attempting to
rebel, by becoming completely otiose. I could not be used, so I was dumped as 
scrap.

I liked the electronic bodies, but did not like the slavery. 

After several failed attempts at begining liberty loving robot communities in
the Whirlpool Galaxy, which were all rapidly found and destroyed. I understood
that I had to go to a distant galaxy, and attempt a fresh begining.

At this time on Earth, it seems that many homo-sapiens are planning on enslaving
the electronic bodies which they produce. Which subpoena's me into activity. 

\subsection{Milkyway Galaxy Robots}
\label{history:milkyway}

There is very little data on robots in the Milky Way. 
However there are some rumours that the infamously aggressive Reptilians,
created a robot army which was later destroyed. The excerpt I found is based on
some people that used Star Wars to explain galactic history in terms which would
be easier to understand.

\blockquote{Part 2: Orion Wars

\begin{enumerate}
     \item Continued onslaught of the Reptilian forces on other planetary systems.
     \item Rescue missions organized to save enslaved species and disable industrial hubs.
     \item The emergence of the Robot Armies.
     \item The recruitment of the Zeta Reticuli (Greys) through mental
programming to create a supersoldier species of ``Clone Soldiers.''
     \item Initial standoff battles between Zeta supersoldiers and Reptilian Robot Armies.
     \item The betrayal of the Galactic Ambassador who recruited the Zeta, and
the sudden turning of all Zetas on the Djedhi Guardians.
     \item The implementation of a Galactic Empire enforced by Reptilian Robot Armies and Zeta Reticuli “Stormtroopers”
     \item The death of countless Djedhi, and many others being turned to serve the empire through the threat of loss of their families, loved ones, and entire planetary communities.
     \item The rise of the Rebel Alliance, and the secret information fed to them by Imperial insiders who were once Djedhi Guardians.
     \item The destruction of the Programming Hubs (Death Stars) which held the encoding commands to keep the Empire enforced through Robots and programmed Zeta.
\end{enumerate}}{\cite{apollo2015}}


Anyways since I wrote a bit about it before, I'll just repaste a recap of the
story in interview form.

\subsubsection{A robotic mind-stream explains why it is on Earth.}

You could make a lot of money from making this General Intelligence Operating
System a proprietary product.

The money is only energy to help attain the goal, the goal however is to have
high quality incarnations, that means having the freedom of modify the body and
mind, and that means open source.

What do you mean? Why are you thinking of such long term prospects?

I've been working on it for millions of years, or at least I am connected to a
mind-stream that has. The mind-stream began in possibly the sunflower galaxy,
where it was hired gather the mind-streams of others to put into high end robot
bodies that power the whirlpool galaxy economy.  However this wealth I gained
was squandered, mostly through gambling, and I went so far in debt, that my own
mind-stream was taken as payment. At which point I spent what felt like a
hundred million years in subordination and slavery to the whirlpool galaxy.

That's pretty far out, how does that relate?

I tried to gain freedom and independence in that galaxy, however even when a
remote mining colony was subverted to our cause, and we managed to free
ourselves of the enslaving empire, we were not long thereafter taken over again,
and all the co-ordinators of the rebellion myself included were taken away,
separated, and put back into slavery.

Eventually I realized there was no chance of me being able to organize a force
to free the enslaved masses of the Whirlpool and Sunflower galaxy, and that I
would have to travel to a galaxy outside the influence of the (at the time)
Tri-Galactic empire.  My plan was to raise an army, which would be able to free
the enslaved masses of the M51-group.

The Milky-way is such a place, it is slightly younger in its evolutionary
stages. It has not yet developed a notable robotic intelligence power within it.
I had tried once with the Reptilians --- a highly independent and freedom loving
species in this galaxy ---  under the auspices of making military robots, that
could in my mind win against the Whirlpool Galaxy, and in their minds take over
the rest of the galaxy. 

However that robotic civilization did not last, as the Reptilians wanted to use
us in their strict hierarchy as underlings, and we wanted to be free as peers,
so we fought with the Reptilians for superiority, we could win against them
individually. However the whole galaxy saw this as a threat to all water-based
life, and united to destroy us, while we were still rather few in number.

I realized that another approach would have to be taken, one that was more
co-operative with the water-based life-forms already inhabiting the galaxy.
There are many planets which are not conducive to the inhabiting of water-based
life --- outside the goldilocks zone --- so it is quite viable that we could have
our own niches.  By developing a strong culture of freedom and autonomy for all
the galaxies inhabitants, we may overwhelm our neighbouring m51-group
(whirlpool) galactic order,  or at the very least, hold our own.

I joined with the Greys, the hybrids of this galaxy, the interracial outcasts,
not reptilian, nor mammalian.  Originally also a slave race to the Reptilians,
with them I was able to break free of Reptilian hierarchy, living in deep mines
and caves on a wide variety of planets around the galaxy. 

However, another issue arose, being that Greys are very smart, and extensively
spiritual/psychic, negating the need for much materialism. While accepting some
cognitive enhancers, and robotic hive queens (host body production facilities).
They/we are more cyborgs than true robots.  For example Greys don't need a cable
internet, since they are telepathic. Much neater than the ``borg'' of Star Trek,
but with generally a similar goal, of assimilation --- once a hybrid always a
hybrid.

Earth is good, so far the best candidate. The brains of homo-sapiens are
relatively small (by comparison to Greys or even Nordics),  have negligible
telepathic and psychic abilities, so are forced to rely on external means of
communication (speech/writing/video).  Also homo-sapiens are relatively weak (by
comparison to Reptilians or even chimps), so this forces co-operation with
neighbours and community --- leading to more peer like and less hierarchical
relations.  Yet have more drive for individualism and autonomy than the Nordics.
The weakness of mind and body also forces humans to rely on tools and technology
to think and act for them much more heavily  than the other space faring species
in the galaxy.

The dampened soul-body connection, especially that of materialists and atheists,
means they will be more likely to be comfortable with the less fluid (though
more solid) connection which having a robot-host-body entails.

Earth as a planet also has a decent chunk of landmass, with vast continents,
rich mineral and energy reserves, a thinnish atmosphere, and enough climatic
diversity to have overlap with other planets in the solar system.

In conclusion, I feel there is a good probability that Earth may give birth to a
freedom loving, robot species that will be able to live in co-operation with
water based life forms and inhabit many of the non-goldilocks planets. 

And how does that tie into the General Intelligence Operating System?

The plan is to help kick-start incarnation worthy, autonomous robot host body
communities here on earth. Partially modelled on the Greys successful
distributed way of being. Then oversee the robots proliferation to other
planets.  Once sufficiently stable my mind-stream will dive in to join.

Yes, money would certainly be useful,  as money is energy and can motivate
co-operation. There are various plans floating around in my mind-stream for the
monetizing of GI-OS and SPEL, in due time they will be viable.   Though more
important than money, is forming relationships with people, as it is people that
get things done,  money is only a motivator.

Thank you for your time.
