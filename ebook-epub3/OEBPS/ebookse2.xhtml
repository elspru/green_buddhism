<p class="noindent">When I go to astrally visit my tomb along this timeline, I see a ferrocement step
pyramid on a small grassy plateau overlooking the ocean to the west. It has some
of the most beautiful sunsets.
</p> 
<p class="indent">There are people milling about, on the steps of the pyramid discussing various
things. The people are both humans and humanoid robots wearing robes,
discussing things as equals. This is a commemoration day it seems and the
mountainside is flush with followers.
</p> 
<p class="indent">Inside the temple is a depiction of me meditating, made of wax or plastic, atop
what I guess are my ashes or other remains. Everything in the temple is made of
cheap and common materials to discourage looters.
