\chapter{Mission}\label{mission}

As with computer sports, there is often a mission to measure success.

\subsection{What is your private mission?}

We with you, in the soul world, with the help of our friends and professors,
 analyze our lives, and see where we can improve. Then we set those as various
purposes for reincarnating, so we with your private mission is educational.

\begin{itemize}
\item Do you remember what your purposes for reincarnation were?
\item Do you know what your private mission is?
\item Some theta-brainwave (from 4hz til 8hz) mind administration (meditation) can help you answer those
questions. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{What is our public mission?}

Our public mission, is to continue as our ancestors, that created the galaxy
world for more complex bodies and educational ecology.  


The mission of Green Buddhism, is to grow the number, diversity and complexity of bodies and
ecologies in the galaxy cosmos. 

If that is compatible with your private mission, or you can ration some time or
resources for
the public mission, we would love your help.

\subsection{Initial Steps}

To understand the initial steps, it is best to tell the history of this galaxy,
and it's neighbours.

Note that while much of the galaxy's history is public information, it is also
secret for various reasons. There is disinformation activity, to allow you to
have a more deep dip into your private mission, and living here on Earth.
