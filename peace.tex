\chapter{Living in Peace}
\label{peace}

The Bodhisattva commands, are followed by the most devout of Mahayana Buddhists.

Here is one that equates causing disconnect in the community with killing ones
own parents. 
\blockquote[``Bodhisattvabhumi'' section of the Yogācārabhūmi Śāstra.]{[Avoid] 
committing any of the five extremely negative actions: 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item killing one's mother, 
  \item killing one's father, 
  \item killing an arhat, 
  \item intentionally drawing blood from a Buddha or 
  \item causing schism in the community by supporting and spreading sectarian views. 
\end{enumerate}
}

This is one of the reasons that in Mahayana Buddhism, there are no ``sects'', 
rather they are schools. All the schools are teaching for the betterment of the
community, so we co-operate. 

Similarly we can be with other races, genuses and forms of life. All forms of
life are schools for the souls that inhabit them.

\blockquote[Buddhist Teachers and Leaders in the United States\cite{racial}]{Our
 collective aspiration within the Buddhist traditions is to become truly 
inclusive and beloved communities.  In this process we are committed to 
honestly and bravely uncovering the ways we create separation and 
unintentionally replicate patterns of inequity and harm.  In the same spirit, 
we are committed to engaging with other faith and social justice groups in 
support of undoing racism throughout our society.
}

In my meditations I've found that often anger I feel towards others, is actually
derived from fear and low self worth within myself. It is one of the ways I
uncovered a way I was creating ``seperation and unintentionally replicating
patterns of inequity and harm''.

Considering the trouble homo-sapiens have had with racial hate amongst their 
own genus, it is not surprising that governments and extraterrestrials do not 
thik homo-sapien populations already have the capacity to form peaceful 
relations with other genuses.

I know that at moments when I felt racial stress, it was because I was
threatened by them. I was apprehensive that my family would be deleted in favour
of theirs. So it seemed to me that I should attack first. 

But there are consequences to attack.

\blockquote[Martin Luther King Jr.]{Hate begets hate; violence begets violence; 
toughness begets a greater toughness. We must meet the forces of hate with the 
power of love\ldots{} Our aim must never be to defeat or humiliate the white 
man, but to win his friendship and understanding.}

A better activity is respect. By the golden rule, if you give respect, you will
attain respect. 

I do not say love, as excess love could lower diversity. 
I say respect; giving other region to live in peace. 

The Greys live in the lithosphere, and robot or electronic body communities 
can live in regions which are not inhabitable by liquid bodies.

In this way, we can all attain living peace in our solar system, 
and galactic domain.
