<p class="noindent">If you are an Earthling you may be interested in what the best case scenario is
for Earth and itâ€™s long term longevity.

<p class="indent">There are many timelines available, all with varying probabilities of being
experienced by any particular person or planet.
</p> 
<p class="indent">I decided to explore a successful timeline that I may experience along the
generous spiritual path.
</p> 
<p class="indent">Curiously enough, this one starts at my death, in my tomb, and continues on for
perhaps a trillion years, for as long as the tomb stands.
</p> 
<p class="indent">About 3.5 thousand words or a 20 minute read.
