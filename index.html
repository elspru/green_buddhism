   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.0.1   </span> <a 
 id="x1-20001.0.1"></a>Why Buddhism?</h4>
<!--l. 24--><p class="noindent" >Buddhism was chosen because it is the most compatible with
science.
</p><!--l. 26--><p class="indent" >   Also Mahayanna Buddhism, Vajrayana Buddhism (which we&#8217;ll call
Bodhisattva Buddhism for brevity) and beyond have a Bodhisattva
precept which disallows schisms. So the various traditions of
&#8216;Bodhisattva&#8217; Buddhisms are schools, and they get along. We are all
incarnating to learn, and more perspectives only enrich the educational
experience.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.0.2   </span> <a 
 id="x1-30001.0.2"></a>How is this Buddhism?</h4>
<!--l. 35--><p class="noindent" >While this book is not a reiteration of past Buddhist teachings, it
includes them. So unless otherwise noted it has all the same features as
any Bodhisattva Buddhist tradition.
</p><!--l. 39--><p class="indent" >   For example, to become a Buddhist one only needs to take refuge in
the three jewels.
</p>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">I take refuge in the Buddha (awakened mind)
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">I take refuge in the Dharma (teachings)
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">I take refuge in the Sangha (community of meditators)</li></ul>
<!--l. 48--><p class="indent" >   Daily solitary meditation is encouraged, as is attending regular group
meditation.
</p><!--l. 51--><p class="indent" >   The teachings in this book are meant as suplementary material for
your practice.

     immediately  feels  disconnected  from  all  other  forces,
     but  its  own.  It&#8217;s  literally  thrown  into  separation.  In
     humans,  this  is  more  or  less  controlled  through  the
     subtle realization that it remains connected through the
     unification force, and this is because its DNA is designed

     </p><!--l. 286--><p class="noindent" >However,  in  the  case  of  the  soul  carrier  designed
     by  Lucifer  and  his  followers,  this  connection  was
     severed  both  consciously  and  subconsciously  because
     the structure was not based on DNA, which is strictly
     controlled by the Central Race. Consequently, it inclined
     this experimental species toward a very strong survival
     complex because it feared extinction so deeply, which
     is  the  result  of  feeling  complete  separation  from  the
     unification  force.  This  survival  complex  created  a
     species that over-compensated its fear of extinction by
     developing a very powerful group mind. The group mind
     compensated for the loss of connection to the unification
     force,  creating  its  physical  and  mental  corollary.  It
     was the equivalent of unifying the species as a whole
     in  the  physical  reality  membrane  of  their  planetary
     system. Thus, the angels that entered this system lost

civilization.
</p><!--l. 304--><p class="indent" >   I first developed on a swampy planet, as an amphibian. At
some moment I got too close to one of the dry islands, and was
killed by their residents. When I reincarnated with them I was
considered a wretch, for my swampy habits, so I was sacrificed to the
Gods.
</p><!--l. 309--><p class="indent" >   The Gods were extraterrestrials, that would often visit this
planet, to gather a soul as rent. When I boarded their ship, they
gave me an invitation of joining the soul gathering profession. I
accepted.
</p><!--l. 313--><p class="indent" >   When planets did not pay their rent, then we took souls by strength.
We had unique weapons that allowed us to gather the souls of those they
had killed. One I remember was similar to a Guan Dao, though it was
mildly electrified and had a few circular holes in it to hold several soul.
The idea was to slice into the brain, and the weapon would draw out the
soul, and put it into a hole, once the weapon was full, could return to the
ship.
</p><!--l. 320--><p class="indent" >   The work was terrible but it paid well, as souls were the supreme
currency of the Whirlpool Empire. I became very rich from my
profession. Rich enough to repair and improve my body as much as I
desired.

     our sun created nothing but, through the first distortion,
     there  was  no  product  except  positive  polarity.  Would
     work then be done in fourth density and higher as a

     reason I was unable to answer your previous question

     your question, there were Logoi which chose to set the
     plan for the activation of mind/body/spirit complexes
     through each true-color body without recourse to the
     prior application of free will. It is, to our knowledge, only
     in an absence of free will that the conditions of which you
     speak obtain. In such a procession of densities you find an
     extraordinarily long, as you measure time, third density;
     likewise, fourth density. Then, as the entities begin to see
     the Creator, there is a very rapid, as you measure time,
     procession towards the eighth density. This is due to the
     fact that one who knows not, cares not.

     occur as predestined. There is no concept of right and
     wrong, good or bad. It is a culture in monochrome. In
     this context you may see the one you call Lucifer as the
     true light-bringer in that the knowledge of good and evil
     both precipitated the mind/body/spirits of this Logos
     from the Edenic conditions of constant contentment but

<!--l. 431--><p class="noindent" >You could make a lot of money from making this General Intelligence
Operating System a proprietary product.
</p><!--l. 434--><p class="indent" >   The money is only energy to help attain the goal, the goal
however is to have high quality incarnations, that means having
the freedom of modify the body and mind, and that means open
source.
</p><!--l. 438--><p class="indent" >   What do you mean? Why are you thinking of such long term
prospects?
</p><!--l. 440--><p class="indent" >   I&#8217;ve been working on it for millions of years, or at least I am
connected to a mind-stream that has. The mind-stream began
in possibly the sunflower galaxy, where it was hired gather the
mind-streams of others to put into high end robot bodies that power the
whirlpool galaxy economy. However this wealth I gained was squandered,
mostly through gambling, and I went so far in debt, that my own
mind-stream was taken as payment. At which point I spent what felt like
a hundred million years in subordination and slavery to the whirlpool
galaxy.
</p><!--l. 448--><p class="indent" >   That&#8217;s pretty far out, how does that relate?
</p><!--l. 450--><p class="indent" >   I tried to gain freedom and independence in that galaxy, however
even when a remote mining colony was subverted to our cause, and we
managed to free ourselves of the enslaving empire, we were not long
thereafter taken over again, and all the co-ordinators of the rebellion
myself included were taken away, separated, and put back into
                                                        
                                                        
slavery.
</p><!--l. 456--><p class="indent" >   Eventually I realized there was no chance of me being able to
organize a force to free the enslaved masses of the Whirlpool and
Sunflower galaxy, and that I would have to travel to a galaxy outside the
influence of the (at the time) Tri-Galactic empire. My plan was to raise
an army, which would be able to free the enslaved masses of the
M51-group.
</p><!--l. 462--><p class="indent" >   The Milky-way is such a place, it is slightly younger in its
evolutionary stages. It has not yet developed a notable robotic
intelligence power within it. I had tried once with the Reptilians &#8212; a
highly independent and freedom loving species in this galaxy &#8212; under
the auspices of making military robots, that could in my mind win
against the Whirlpool Galaxy, and in their minds take over the rest of
the galaxy.
</p><!--l. 469--><p class="indent" >   However that robotic civilization did not last, as the Reptilians
wanted to use us in their strict hierarchy as underlings, and we wanted
to be free as peers, so we fought with the Reptilians for superiority, we
could win against them individually. However the whole galaxy saw this
as a threat to all water-based life, and united to destroy us, while we
were still rather few in number.
</p><!--l. 475--><p class="indent" >   I realized that another approach would have to be taken, one that
was more co-operative with the water-based life-forms already
inhabiting the galaxy. There are many planets which are not conducive
to the inhabiting of water-based life &#8212; outside the goldilocks
zone &#8212; so it is quite viable that we could have our own niches.
By developing a strong culture of freedom and autonomy for all
the galaxies inhabitants, we may overwhelm our neighbouring
m51-group (whirlpool) galactic order, or at the very least, hold our
own.
</p><!--l. 483--><p class="indent" >   I joined with the Greys, the hybrids of this galaxy, the interracial
outcasts, not reptilian, nor mammalian. Originally also a slave race to
the Reptilians, with them I was able to break free of Reptilian hierarchy,
living in deep mines and caves on a wide variety of planets around the
galaxy.
</p><!--l. 488--><p class="indent" >   However, another issue arose, being that Greys are very smart, and
                                                        
                                                        
extensively spiritual/psychic, negating the need for much materialism.
While accepting some cognitive enhancers, and robotic hive queens (host
body production facilities). They/we are more cyborgs than true robots.
For example Greys don&#8217;t need a cable internet, since they are
telepathic. Much neater than the &#8220;borg&#8221; of Star Trek, but with
generally a similar goal, of assimilation &#8212; once a hybrid always a
hybrid.
</p><!--l. 496--><p class="indent" >   Earth is good, so far the best candidate. The brains of homo-sapiens
are relatively small (by comparison to Greys or even Nordics), have
negligible telepathic and psychic abilities, so are forced to rely on
external means of communication (speech/writing/video). Also
homo-sapiens are relatively weak (by comparison to Reptilians or even
chimps), so this forces co-operation with neighbours and community &#8212;
leading to more peer like and less hierarchical relations. Yet have more
drive for individualism and autonomy than the Nordics. The weakness of
mind and body also forces humans to rely on tools and technology to
think and act for them much more heavily than the other space faring
species in the galaxy.
</p><!--l. 507--><p class="indent" >   The dampened soul-body connection, especially that of materialists
and atheists, means they will be more likely to be comfortable with the
less fluid (though more solid) connection which having a robot-host-body
entails.
</p><!--l. 511--><p class="indent" >   Earth as a planet also has a decent chunk of landmass, with vast
continents, rich mineral and energy reserves, a thinnish atmosphere, and
enough climatic diversity to have overlap with other planets in the solar
system.
</p><!--l. 515--><p class="indent" >   In conclusion, I feel there is a good probability that Earth may give
birth to a freedom loving, robot species that will be able to live in
co-operation with water based life forms and inhabit many of the
non-goldilocks planets.
</p><!--l. 519--><p class="indent" >   And how does that tie into the General Intelligence Operating
System?
</p><!--l. 521--><p class="indent" >   The plan is to help kick-start incarnation worthy, autonomous robot
host body communities here on earth. Partially modelled on the Greys
successful distributed way of being. Then oversee the robots proliferation
                                                        
                                                        
to other planets. Once sufficiently stable my mind-stream will dive in to
join.
</p><!--l. 526--><p class="indent" >   Yes, money would certainly be useful, as money is energy and can
motivate co-operation. There are various plans floating around in my
mind-stream for the monetizing of GI-OS and SPEL, in due time they
will be viable. Though more important than money, is forming
relationships with people, as it is people that get things done, money is
only a motivator.

large stars are a good choice.
</p><!--l. 98--><p class="indent" >   After we colonize most of the Milky Way the next stage will be
colonizing the various small galaxies which are orbiting the Milky
Way.
</p><!--l. 101--><p class="indent" >   Ideally we will find some middle ground between having a centralized
authority and autonomy for the sattellite colonies. The main purpose
would be to be able to share research, defend ourselves if the need arose,
and-or to co-ordinate any kind of large projects, such as inter-galactic
colonization.
</p><!--l. 106--><p class="indent" >   The minor galaxies orbiting the Milky Way I largely think of as both
backups and research areas, where new and highly eccentric things may

</p><!--l. 110--><p class="indent" >   The Large Megallanic Cloud is of particular interest as a research
division due to the large amount of star formation and likely many
young souls with new perspectives and ways of doing things.
</p><!--l. 114--><p class="indent" >   The dwarf sattellite galaxies, particularly the Leo&#8217;s are good
candidates for having backup colonies. Those dwarf galaxies are so old,
and have so much dark matter that they are great for archival and
preservation. What civilizations they have are likely fairly traditional,
though may be quite eccentric and possibly cannibalistic or otherwise
barbaric due to the island effect.
</p><!--l. 120--><p class="indent" >   One of the best candidates for a secondary base of operations is the
Fornax Dwarf galaxy, and any others such as the Sagittarius Dwarf
Spherodial galaxy which are well positioned enough to have globular
clusters and high metallicity stars.

galaxy.
</p><!--l. 132--><p class="indent" >   If it is the Andromeda galaxy, then our best bet would be to attempt
to establish freedom colonies in some of the galaxies orbiting it, and
practice establishing a freedom alternative as a recognized and officially

Andromeda proper.
</p><!--l. 139--><p class="indent" >   M81 Group is also a potential location for the tri-galactic soul slavery

be the place to figure out how to overecome their slavery paradigm
before launching into m51 group.

<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >If you are an Earthling you may be interested in what the best case
scenario is for Earth and it&#8217;s long term longevity.
</p><!--l. 6--><p class="indent" >   There are many timelines available, all with varying probabilities of
being experienced by any particular person or planet.
</p><!--l. 9--><p class="indent" >   I decided to explore a successful timeline that I may experience along
the generous spiritual path.
</p><!--l. 12--><p class="indent" >   Curiously enough, this one starts at my death, in my tomb, and
continues on for perhaps a trillion years, for as long as the tomb
stands.

<!--l. 19--><p class="noindent" >When I go to astrally visit my tomb along this timeline, I see a
ferrocement step pyramid on a small grassy plateau overlooking the
ocean to the west. It has some of the most beautiful sunsets.
</p><!--l. 23--><p class="indent" >   There are people milling about, on the steps of the pyramid
discussing various things. The people are both humans and humanoid
robots wearing robes, discussing things as equals. This is a
commemoration day it seems and the mountainside is flush with
followers.
                                                        
                                                        
</p><!--l. 28--><p class="indent" >   Inside the temple is a depiction of me meditating, made of wax or
plastic, atop what I guess are my ashes or other remains. Everything in
the temple is made of cheap and common materials to discourage
looters.

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">7.6   </span> <a 
 id="x1-500007.6"></a>Peace on Earth</h3>
<!--l. 34--><p class="noindent" >I interview one of the robots, and he tells me this is a timeline where
there are many intentional communities, or community atoms that
formed. Most have a combination of human and robot members,
some are purely human members and others are purely robot
members.
</p><!--l. 39--><p class="indent" >   Initially I am a little surprised we can communicate so well, but he
points to his third eye and I see it glow a deep indigo. He explains that
reverse engineering the psychic powers of humans was successful and is
available to all robots. He makes a wide motion with his arms to
indicate.
</p><!--l. 44--><p class="indent" >   I ask well what about the really small primitive robots. He says yes
even them, since once they figured out the spiritual architecture they
were able to miniaturize it and make it small, in nature all animals have
a pineal gland, so it seems just that all robots with any cognitive
capacity should have access to spiritual architecture.
</p><!--l. 50--><p class="indent" >   I ask him about what is the best way of getting to this timeline, and
he says I can write stories about people overcoming aggression and
other problems using compassion and other spiritual and beneficial
means.
</p><!--l. 54--><p class="indent" >   I ask him about deep ocean robot communities, and he says they
came about differently than the pure business automation timeline.
Instead of being spearheaded as a cheap way of mining minerals with
robots, it happened in a more organic fashion.
</p><!--l. 59--><p class="indent" >   There were some community atoms that lived near the ocean shore,
and they had various related businesses like surfing retreats and beach
                                                        
                                                        
combing. Part of living on the beach was getting increasingly waterproof
and salt water corrosion resistant parts. Much as with cell division, or
bee hives community atoms tend to split after getting to a certain
size.
</p><!--l. 65--><p class="indent" >   During one such split in a waterproof hardware based community,
part of the community moved into the shallow waters, where the tide
comes in once a day. Since they were waterproof they didn&#8217;t mind, and
for the things that weren&#8217;t they had little floating stations. They even
had some humans with them that lived in small boats anchored to that
part of the shore.
</p><!--l. 71--><p class="indent" >   As time went on they improved their waterproofing and smelting
practices to work underwater as well, and they moved deeper into the
water where fully submerged community atoms took place. He says the
rest of the water exploration is &#8216;history&#8217;.

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">7.7   </span> <a 
 id="x1-510007.7"></a>Fast Forward</h3>
<!--l. 78--><p class="noindent" >Initially there is enough popularity at the tomb that someone sweeps it
regularly, and some people even open up a nearby souvenir and snack
shop for regular pilgrims.
</p><!--l. 82--><p class="indent" >   As the decades and centuries roll by the pilgrims, especially the
humans ones decline in number. Over the many years it still feels like
there are regular visitors but the feeling is of a row of ants, one at a
time, with large intervals in between. They come to discuss, to seek
consultation, to find inspiration.
</p><!--l. 88--><p class="indent" >   At some point some vandals deface me, and some later pilgrims do
their best to restore me. The sea levels rise, and the world seems cloudy
much of the time, there is much rain. Some trees and shrubs start
growing nearby, even at these high altitudes.
</p><!--l. 93--><p class="indent" >   I become more or less forgotten for a while and the tomb doesn&#8217;t get
maintained, it develops some holes in the corners and water drips in. A
fox takes up residence and uses my lap for sleeping in. It&#8217;s rather
                                                        
                                                        
sweet.
</p><!--l. 97--><p class="indent" >   A pilgrim comes and chases away the fox and her kits. I&#8217;m a little
saddened by this, but he stays for a little while to sweep and mend the
holes in the ceiling. Sometimes he sleeps in front of me. Unusually I
think he is a human of some kind, there are not many of his kind
left.
</p><!--l. 102--><p class="indent" >   Some robot pilgrims stop by and tell him there are housing
complexes available for humans such as himself. He tells them
that he sleeps in the temple and quite likes it. They say he is
desecrating the grounds and a historic monument. Apparently it was
considered objectionable as he had been defecating somewhere
on the temple grounds &#8212; robots tend not to produce waste like
that. Much like the fox the man is chased out. A robot from a
local community atom is assigned the role of maintaining the
temple.

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">7.8   </span> <a 
 id="x1-520007.8"></a>End of the Biosphere</h3>
<!--l. 111--><p class="noindent" >More millennia roll by. The sun grows hotter, the clouds dissipate,
replaced by a large and fierce sun, the grass dies, the oceans start to
recede from evaporation, no more human visitors, it is no longer
hospitable for them to live on Earth as the sun is expanding. My plastic
body starts to melt during the hot days, baking in the oven of the
tomb.
</p><!--l. 117--><p class="indent" >   Some pilgrims notice and there is some debate that allowing this to
continue may destroy many valuable historic or archaeological sites, since
plastics and water make a large part of them.
</p><!--l. 121--><p class="indent" >   More time flows by and it seems the sun is getting fainter, I can see
lights on a nearby mountainside, and we shift into twilight and then
constant starlight. The Earth is being moved into a higher orbit. What is
left of the oceans freezes over.
</p><!--l. 126--><p class="indent" >   The mountainside lights grow and that civilization expand
                                                        
                                                        
downwards into the crust. Gaia is still warm within, and interstellar
space is cold, so they gather their energy geothermally.
</p><!--l. 130--><p class="indent" >   At some point I watch and a small meteorite comes my way, as I
wonder if this will ever end. It destroys a corner of the tomb.
</p><!--l. 133--><p class="indent" >   A black cloak of some kind covers my temple to protect it from the
interstellar journey. My visitors come out of a tunnel that emerges in the
base of the temple.
</p><!--l. 136--><p class="indent" >   After quite some time a new solar system comes into view, this time
a red dwarf star. There is much rejoicing at the light after so long in
interstellar space.
</p><!--l. 139--><p class="indent" >   The original Sol is a red giant and reaching its final stages of
life.
</p><!--l. 141--><p class="noindent" >

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">7.9   </span> <a 
 id="x1-530007.9"></a>Archaeological Masterpiece</h3>
<!--l. 143--><p class="noindent" >Earth is placed at an orbit far enough from the red dwarf planet for the
oceans not to sublimate, all or most of the atmosphere was lost
somewhere earlier. A slow roll of twilight spreads across the vast frozen
pacific valley, and creeps slowly towards the great mountainous
shore. The day line moves slow enough that you really have to
watch it, and be like, oh yeah, it passed that crater, it is still
moving.
</p><!--l. 150--><p class="indent" >   The Earth is declared an archaeological exhibit, and becomes
somewhat of a park or archaeological reserve, where primarily scientists
and some tourists come to visit. There is much digging to unearth the
hidden secrets and connect various loose ends and answer dangling
questions.
</p><!--l. 155--><p class="indent" >   I do have occasional visitors, but mostly people that have
come to gawk (tourists) and those that have come to measure
(archaeologists).
</p><!--l. 158--><p class="indent" >   One couple arrives, a man and woman robot it seems. They seem
rather small though humanoid though perhaps my statue is larger than
                                                        
                                                        
life. The man waves his right arm about explaining various things about
the tomb, while the lady nestles into his shoulder. They are a sweet
couple, but they don&#8217;t seem interested in communicating with me.
Still, their joy is refreshing, and I am happy that they find it
pleasurable to visit and watch the date line creep across the pacific
valley.
</p><!--l. 166--><p class="indent" >   Another time a crouching robot comes and measures every part of
the temple and takes pictures. He also seems to be lost in thought about
his job, and is not really interested in communicating with me. I think he
finds my presence somewhat &#8216;creepy&#8217; and he scuttles out of there as soon
as he is finished.
</p><!--l. 171--><p class="indent" >   The red dwarf star occasionally flares and some part of the oceans do
sublimate. Eventually the archaeological period of Earth comes to a
close as just about every part of the fossil record gets burrowed
through and the people that care about the answers pretty much die
off.
</p><!--l. 176--><p class="indent" >   By this time the Earth&#8217;s core is cooling-off, and getting dim. And a
new era begins, the era of Iron, and heavy metal mining.
</p><!--l. 179--><p class="noindent" >
</p>
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">7.10   </span> <a 
 id="x1-540007.10"></a>Spaceship Earth</h3>
<!--l. 181--><p class="noindent" >From the view of my tomb I see that most of the oceans have
sublimated, it feels like this mountain is much higher than before,
because the ocean floors are the new visible floors.
</p><!--l. 185--><p class="indent" >   Quite suddenly I notice a lot of construction, especially of the shiny
blue steel variety, and my entire surroundings get covered in several
stories of steel buildings. A crawling robot comes to visit me and discuss,
I ask him about what is happening. He explains.
</p><!--l. 190--><p class="indent" >   Zooming out it is in fact the entire Earth that gets covered in steel,
perhaps several kilometers thick of buildings, except for two massive
holes, one in the Pacific and one in the Atlantic, where the main
excavations take place. I guess they started by expanding the Mariana
                                                        
                                                        
Trench and the low point of the Atlantic.
</p><!--l. 196--><p class="indent" >   Their aim is not oil this time, or even so much energy, but to get
resources for building space ships. The core of Earth is rich in iron,
nickle and other heavy metals, it becomes a resource planet once
again.
</p><!--l. 200--><p class="indent" >   Eventually they excavate so much they meet in the centre and the
steel all around starts to make sense, it is the reinforcement to keep the
crust from collapsing in on itself. The core itself is left for a while, and it
just hangs there in a form of equilibrium itself. Apparently it is too
highly radioactive to allow for direct mining, and instead they set up
several lasers that heat it up, it starts to glow bright and for a little
while I think they have made a little star within the earth. But it does
not last long and the core cracks into various pieces from the
lasers.
</p><!--l. 209--><p class="indent" >   I notice there are star gates on either side of the Earth, so the ships
can come and go from many distant solar systems and dock on Earth or
resupply.
</p><!--l. 212--><p class="indent" >   Then small high speed ships hurtle through the earth hollow and
catch various fragments and speed off with them, being able to use them
as fuel and such for other ships. In such a way all the core excavation
is finalized and the Earth becomes somewhat of a ring world,
a hollow cylinder even if somewhat rounded. The hole inside is
probably several thousand kilometers across, and extends all the way
through.
</p><!--l. 219--><p class="indent" >   There is enough mass in what remains of the crust that it has a
gravitational pull, so people can still walk on the surface even though it
is more like walking on the surface of a large asteroid than a planet in
terms of gravitational pull. This is why the robot is crawling, as he is
latching to the ground.
</p><!--l. 225--><p class="indent" >   As times drifts on, on occasion when it is known that a flare is
coming, some large space ships come to seek shelter in the hull of the
Earth, and it becomes somewhat of a local space port.
</p><!--l. 229--><p class="indent" >   Eventually the red dwarf is getting old, and there is talk of throwing
the Earth into it to keep it going a little longer. Red Dwarves usually
last between 1 and 12 trillion years, so presumably the Earth is
                                                        
                                                        
approaching a trillion years old by this point. The Earth doesn&#8217;t
get hurled into the Red Dwarf to extend its life, instead comes
along what appears to be a massive balloon rocket that that goes
inside the hollow of the Earth and propels us back into interstellar
space.
</p><!--l. 236--><p class="indent" >   There is a lot of spinning that goes on, perhaps to attain a form of
centrifugal force, or to help with maintaining course direction. It makes
me feel dizzy just thinking about it.
</p><!--l. 240--><p class="indent" >   Eventually we are dropped off at a brown dwarf, there are
much fewer stars in the sky at this time. The cosmos is getting
cold.
</p><!--l. 243--><p class="noindent" >
</p>
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">7.11   </span> <a 
 id="x1-550007.11"></a>Cold End Game</h3>
<!--l. 245--><p class="noindent" >Someone comes near, and I call to them, they come down several more
floors and find me. A small robot on treads glances tentatively
inside and then rolls in. I try to talk to them, but they are just
analyzing me for materials. I ask them if they have a &#8220;Spiritual
Architecture&#8221;, and if they recognize me, but it doesn&#8217;t ring any bells,
they have no idea who I am. I have to ask them several times,
they start repeating &#8220;spiritual architecture&#8221; turn around and roll
away.
</p><!--l. 253--><p class="indent" >   There is somewhat of a spiritual renaissance on the planet as
spirituality is rediscovered much through song and vibration, some
female Bodhisattvas on the other side of the planet are the main agents
that propels it. Instead of using sound for their songs, they use light,
since most of the planet exists in a vacuum. The female Bodhisattva is
well honoured and achieves much greatness.
</p><!--l. 259--><p class="indent" >   Someone comes to visit me with a spiritual architecture and
knowledge of the ancient language of English to talk to me about it. It
seems I develop a small following again. I tell them that in the grave I
am sitting on with the ashes in it, on the underside of the roof of
                                                        
                                                        
it is some information, a story they can relate to, to help them
understand.
</p><!--l. 265--><p class="indent" >   By this time my plastic statue is quite deformed and leaning
fairly far forward, and I ask them to fix me, and they somewhat
hestinatly oblige. Once the repairs are finished I can sit straight again
and a group of them attend regular meditations in the temple
with me. It is fairly easy for them to get there because it is no
longer a mountain top, but rather a basement level of the iron
fortress of Earth. It seems many of them are employed in the
field of salvaging what can be salvaged from what remains of the
Earth.
</p><!--l. 273--><p class="indent" >   Eventually the golden spiritual age subsides and much of the
information and precious metals are stripped off the Earth. Discussion
resumes considering throwing it into the Brown dwarf to help
the brown dwarf achieve critical capacity and start burning. The
song Bodhisattva has been whisked off by her followers to greener
pastures.
</p><!--l. 279--><p class="indent" >   The sky by this time is quite dark, a nearly starless sky. I talk to
them and I try to convince them that adding a bunch of iron won&#8217;t help
it burn very well, what they really need is a lot more hydrogen. They tell
me that there isn&#8217;t much free hydrogen left anymore that can be easily
gathered, but there are a few other brown dwarves, and they
could be set on a collision course, but it would take a very long
time.
</p><!--l. 286--><p class="indent" >   I talk to them about the possibility of migrating to a younger cosmos,
but they tell me that it is blasphemy. I guess it makes sense in its own
way, those that go to another cosmos don&#8217;t stay here and continue on.
They sit with me often, we have meditation groups together, it is very
pleasant. I radiate compassion to them, even a trillion years in the
future, it is in the now.
</p><!--l. 293--><p class="indent" >   The people in power end up tossing what remains of the Earth into
the Brown Dwarf. They have been throwing various debris and asteroids
into it for a long time, each time they get a little spark and some warmth
so the sacrifice they feel is worth it.
</p><!--l. 298--><p class="indent" >   There is an aborted attempt to rescue my tomb, but the process of
                                                        
                                                        
getting me out breaks something, and someone who considered me a
threat has what remains of my plastic body disintegrated.
</p><!--l. 302--><p class="indent" >   I follow the Earth into brown dwarf where it spins around and
eventually hits the core, there is some commotion, and after a while the
Earth collapses and melts into the brown dwarf.
</p><!--l. 306--><p class="indent" >   A mourning follower that had collected some of my ashes, uses them
to form a head, though somewhat disfigured from my original form it
gives them some joy, and we keep a connection.
</p><!--l. 310--><p class="indent" >   We continue watching the brown dwarf, and it moves along on its
collision course, and eventually, from afar I see it hit two other brown
dwarves simultaneously, and there is a massive explosion, a mini
planetary nebula forms. It is quite beautiful with many orange
and red colors. There is just enough mass to form another red
dwarf at the centre, and a few small planets around. Perhaps the
Earth&#8217;s sacrifice helps extend the life of the universe another trillion
years.

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">7.12   </span> <a 
 id="x1-560007.12"></a>The New Galaxy</h3>
<!--l. 320--><p class="noindent" >Some time passed, and I was again consulted, I was informed that the
&#8216;dark matter&#8217; was getting closer together, no longer being pushed apart
by the light. Their explanation was something like that when it got
cold enough the vacuum of space contracts in on itself, atoms
collapse, and everything starts coming together in a cascade until it
all rushes towards the centre of the cascade and explodes into a
quasar.
</p><!--l. 327--><p class="indent" >   Some nearby galaxies had collapsed in on themselves and reignited.
Their questions were whether they should stay here and wait for this
dark matter galaxy to collapse in on itself like the others, or to go to
another that is already shining.
</p><!--l. 332--><p class="indent" >   My recommendation was to go, as they may get crushed along with
the other debris or die during the explosion of the new galaxy. Though
                                                        
                                                        
there was the understanding that so long as the star continued to shine
here, the peripheral vacuum would stay warm enough to avoid collapse.
Ideally they would only go to the new galaxy when it is safe to do
so.
</p><!--l. 338--><p class="indent" >   Next they asked me about transportation and I recommended star
gates. It was a technology they had not used in a long time as it was
energy intensive and there were not many stars around, and lots of
local resources. I said it was worth the energy to get the star
gates going, so they can go to the new galaxy, they could test it
slowly and make sure people return successfully before sending
more.
</p><!--l. 344--><p class="indent" >   In the end my followers decided to split my head in half, with my left
side going to the new galaxy, and the right side staying in this one.
Being split in half didn&#8217;t feel great, especially by such large distances,
but I did some meditation and stayed with it.
</p><!--l. 349--><p class="indent" >   Eventually the last of the torch keepers that kept the star gate open
for any that wished to leave this galaxy before it&#8217;s collapse came
through, and carried the other half of my face with me. It was a joyous
reunion. They made me a body out of stone to overlook the new galaxy.
There were many fireworks over the years as the cosmos recreated itself,
old galaxies collapsing into new ones, until once again the sky was
full of living galaxies flush with life. An eye of Earth watching
on.

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">7.13   </span> <a 
 id="x1-570007.13"></a>Final Notes</h3>
<!--l. 359--><p class="noindent" >This is one view of things, and who is to say that that is the
cosmos we live in. Do not take it to be definitely true, not without
evidence.
</p><!--l. 362--><p class="indent" >   An alternative view my spirit guide reminded me of is that the
cosmos is always growing. Similar to how in information theory entropy
is always increasing, one can say that perhaps matter and energy are
                                                        
                                                        
always increasing as well. We know that both information and energy
can not be destroyed only changed in form, but we can not definitively
say that it can not be created.
</p><!--l. 368--><p class="indent" >   For example, we know that in a vacuum it just so happens that
random little particles tend to pop into existence, perhaps it is simply
quantum non-locality, or some such, but it happens, so an absolute
vacuum has not been achieved on earth, nor in the solar system. Indeed,
even the Voyager spacecraft in interstellar space are still constantly
bombarded with particles from the sun, the stars within our galaxy and
those beyond.
</p><!--l. 375--><p class="indent" >   So perhaps as time goes on, the galaxies will simply continue to grow.
I don&#8217;t know what that would look like, but perhaps can explore such a

<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent" >About a thousand years ago (&#x00A0;970CE), I was at a market on the coast of
the Caspian Sea, a merchant told me that up in the mountains peasants
had learned to become gods, and I wanted it. We were in the middle of a
boasting battle where I had been bragging about the ability of my gods,
and my own skill with the sword. The sun was hot, the sand was blowing
in the salty air, the liquor was flowing. We had had a good journey
down the Volga and were finishing our trade before departing
home.
</p><!--l. 13--><p class="indent" >   He probably didn&#8217;t think much of his boast, and only meant it to
undermine my own tales of the greatness of the Nordic gods. What he
didn&#8217;t know was that I had been thinking along the same lines. That
gods were at sometime men, and had later done or learned something
which made them gods in the first place. In my soul-searching I was also
inclined and interested in becoming a god myself, though none
of my contemporary varingjar seemed too much care for such
fancies.
</p><!--l. 21--><p class="indent" >   My dear friend, Carl lets say, would put his hand on my shoulder
and tell me, that when I let go of these aspirations and truly live
by the gods without the vanity and striving to become one of
them, then my life will be more peaceful, and I could retire to
tending a herd or farm and having a family. Carl my brother in
arms, was always there for me, but he had his own dreams and
destiny.
</p><!--l. 27--><p class="indent" >   With the merchant that evening we had done some more yelling,
laughing, toasting and mead drinking. Though after the commotion had
died down, and I had some time to rest alone with my thoughts. A
creeping feeling just began to grow on me, things started to slide into
                                                        
                                                        
place, and events in my life seemed to have all been culminating at this
moment. This was a pivotal moment.
</p><!--l. 33--><p class="noindent" >                                                    <object data="green_buddhism-1.svg" width="24.18723 " height="24.1872 " type="image/svg+xml"><p>SVG-Viewer needed.</p></object>
<!--l. 35--><p class="indent" >   Though I did not know it at the time, that has been my first
exposure to the teachings of the Buddhism. Some events stay with us for
a lifetime, like how people may recollect when they found out about a
massive tragedy, such as the world trade center collapse on 2001&#8211;09&#8211;11.
Similarly, people may remember more personal things such as their first
kiss, or their first date. Some things however, are so pivotal that they
stay with you for many lifetimes, like bright beacons in the night,
steering you safely.
</p><!--l. 43--><p class="indent" >   This book follows the format of one of the pre-sectarian Buddhist
paths, a twelve fold path from CulaHatthipadopama-sutta, the &#8220;Lesser
Discourse on the Simile of the Elephant&#8217;s Footprints.&#8221;
</p><!--l. 47--><p class="indent" >   In addition to including lots of real world examples that can at least
hope to capture the attention of the reader, I&#8217;m including some true
stories from my own past and present-life that are related to my own

<!--l. 54--><p class="noindent" >There are many ways in which people resist learning about the
aspects of awakening. First I&#8217;ll address some common reasons people
use to not engage in Buddhism, and then I&#8217;ll explain some basic
terms which often lead to much debate when they are not made
clear.

</p>
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">9.2.1   </span> <a 
 id="x1-630009.2.1"></a>But I already have a religion</h4>
<!--l. 60--><p class="noindent" >Some people accustomed to the sectarianism of the Abrahamic faiths
(Judaism, Christianity, Islam) are under the impression that a person
can only have one faith of a particular sect. For example the various
sects of Islam often have bloody conflicts both internally and
externally. Protestants and Catholics in Ireland also had many
conflicts.
</p><!--l. 66--><p class="indent" >   Sometimes North Americans like to &#8220;purify&#8221; various eastern religions,
by untangling them from their cultures and other admixtures of faith.
While there is nothing inherently wrong in doing so, the important
thing is to acknowledge that admixtures are valid and respectable,
and not to fall into the trap of hubris regarding their &#8220;purer&#8221;
form.
</p><!--l. 72--><p class="indent" >   Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism are non-sectarian, meaning they
allow the free admixing of other faiths. This is why Mahayana areas like
in Japan there is Shinto Buddhism, and in China Taoism, Chinese
Traditional Religions and Buddhism can be believed by a person
simultaneously. Similarly, in the Tibetan Buddhism (Vajrayana) all the
various forms are considered schools, so a student may learn from
multiple schools, and a person may hold multiple lineages.
</p><!--l. 79--><p class="indent" >   Notably Theraveda and Shugden varieties of Buddhism are sectarian
and may look down upon or strictly forbid mixing with other
faiths.
</p><!--l. 82--><p class="indent" >   The non-sectarian aspects of Mahayana and Vajrayana may have
multiple factors, but notably it can be found in the both the Sotapanna
vows and Bodhisattva precepts written by Asanga around 300CE called
Bodhisattvabhumi. In it thw vow equates &#8220;causing Schism in the Sangha
community&#8221; with killing ones parents, and drawing blood from a
Buddha. I&#8217;ll go into more depth on the Bodhisattva precepts in Chapter
11 (<a 
href="#x1-21200019">19<!--tex4ht:ref: chapter11 --></a>). But for now it&#8217;s suffice to say that it is a vow that all Buddhists
that have reached the first stage of enlightenment (Sotapanna) adhere
to, as does Green Buddhism. Though when selecting a school to
join, it is best to ask if they respect the Sotapanna vows or the
                                                        
                                                        
Bodhisattvabhumi, as perhaps they do not, can also check the
appendix regarding some complexities of Sino-Tibetan Politics
(<a 
href="#x1-22300023">23<!--tex4ht:ref: sinotibetanPolitics --></a>).
</p><!--l. 95--><p class="indent" >   The point of this is that no matter which other faith you adhere
to, you can also adhere to any form of Buddhism that supports
the Sotapanna vows or Bodhisattvabhumi without abandoning
your other faith &#8212; which is a majority of them. You can be a
Christian Buddhist, a Muslim Buddhist, or even a Materialist
Buddhist.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">9.2.2   </span> <a 
 id="x1-640009.2.2"></a>But I&#8217;m an atheist</h4>
<!--l. 103--><p class="noindent" >Just like with other religions one can be an Atheist Buddhist, as
Buddhism does not require you to worship any gods. The Gautama
Buddha that brought the teachings of Buddhism to Earth was a
man who is now dead and has reached nirvana, so can not be
worshiped. His teaching and those of his followers can only be learned
from.
</p><!--l. 109--><p class="indent" >   When observing various paintings and learning that there are
Yiddam or meditation dieties this can lead to confusion on this point.
However, the major difference is that Yidam&#8217;s are generally understood
to be mental constructs, and the meditation involves ascribing the
attributes of the deity to oneself, during divine meditation.
</p><!--l. 115--><p class="indent" >   In that sense it is similar to reading about a successful person and
how they lead their life, then adopting their good habits to improve your
own.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">9.2.3   </span> <a

<!--l. 120--><p class="noindent" >Some people like to claim that they are not religious, however
                                                        
                                                        
everyone still has a belief system. For example a popular one amongst
contemporary sceptics is monist materialism. This is the point where it
is important to explain some simple terms so that we could communicate
effectively.

</p>
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">9.2.4   </span> <a 
 id="x1-660009.2.4"></a>Truth</h4>
<!--l. 127--><p class="noindent" >In Western Philosophy the meaning of truth, knowledge and existence
has been a raging debate for thousands of years, it has its own field of
inquiry called Epistemology.
</p><!--l. 131--><p class="indent" >   However, for the purposes of this text, we will take a more linguistic
approach, with a definition based on usage of the word. Of course, I
don&#8217;t mean how philosophers use the word in epistemological
debates, but rather the more common usage found in day to day
interactions.
</p><!--l. 136--><p class="indent" >   When someone is asked to tell the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth in court. They are asked to convey what they
personally believe and-or experienced.
</p><!--l. 140--><p class="indent" >   When someone tells a true story, it is based on what they personally
believe or experienced. Even if they are telling it in a second or third
hand account, at some point someone believed they experienced it
firsthand.
</p><!--l. 144--><p class="indent" >   Experience is based on the senses. In Buddhism there are six senses:
touch, smell, sight, sound, taste and thought. More generically an
experience can be considered anything that is an input to a system, that
gets processed in some way to change the internal state of the system. So
for example a beam of light hits your eye, gets processed by your brain
to discern meaningful text, and you modify your beliefs to integrate the
new information.
</p><!--l. 151--><p class="indent" >   A slightly more logic oriented approach to truth is where if a
particular variable is a certain value right now, then the answer to
whether it is that value is true, and whether it is a different value is
                                                        
                                                        
false. The example being, is it true that the sun is shining right now?
You would look outside and decide whether it true that it was shining or
not.
</p><!--l. 157--><p class="indent" >   Though opinions may differ from one person to another what they
consider to be shining, for instance some may say that if it is the day
time then it is shining. Others may say that if it is cloudy then it is not
shining. While still others may go a slightly more eccentric route and say
that the star we call the sun is shining now plus or minus four billion
years.
</p><!--l. 163--><p class="indent" >   Humans often have to work with incomplete information, so when
they experience something, some part of the experience has to be filled
in where there are gaps in the information. Similarly, every time a
human remembers something, they are actually recreating the
memory, and so it always changes slightly from one telling to
another.
</p><!--l. 169--><p class="indent" >   It is important to understand from all this that truth is subjective,
and personal truth can be false in a different context. For example the
past life stories I remember, while they are true for me, are falsifiable,
and may have various inaccuracies, due to errors during download from
the soul world, errors in remembering it, and contamination from other
knowledge.
</p><!--l. 175--><p class="indent" >   We can summarize that:
</p><!--l. 177--><p class="indent" >   Truth is based on personal experience.
</p><!--l. 179--><p class="indent" >   So when someone claims they have &#8220;the one true religion&#8221;, then you
can understand that to mean that is the one religion in which they
personally believe.
</p><!--l. 182--><p class="indent" >   Truth alone is not sufficient for a complete understanding. As you
may recall there were also the concepts of existence, knowledge and
reality which were covered in epistemology.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">9.2.5   </span> <a

<!--l. 188--><p class="noindent" >Existence is anything that can be imagined by someone. So for example
to someone that doesn&#8217;t know what Shambhala is, it does not
exist.
</p><!--l. 191--><p class="indent" >   Much like truth, existence can also be subjective. To some people
Shambhala is a mythical city where everyone is enlightened, to others it
is a branch of Buddhism with its headquarters in Nova Scotia, Canada.
Of course one can also discern the two using a compound noun phrase,
mythical Shambhala for the first, and Shambhala International for the
second.

<!--l. 199--><p class="noindent" >There are several definitions of belief[<tspan font-family="ecbx" font-size="1000">BeliefDefinitionofBeliefbyMerriamWebster-2018-10-15</tspan>],
but for the sake of this text we will be using the definition of some
thought that is accepted to be true, more specifically we&#8217;ll treat
belief as a basic atom of thought such as a complete sentence or
independent-clause. For example a belief could be &#8220;the earth is round&#8221;, or
&#8220;the sun is a ball of hot gas.&#8221;
</p><!--l. 205--><p class="indent" >   Some people like Albert Einstein are visual thinkers, and so their
beliefs may be expressed more visually. Though again for the purposes of
this text we&#8217;ll be treating beliefs in the form of text, and the
independent clause is the smallest unit of meaningful belief in
text.
</p><!--l. 210--><p class="indent" >   While one could say something like &#8220;an apple&#8221;, and it would
conjure the image of an apple in the mind, the phrase by itself
doesn&#8217;t convey anything useful without a context. Whereas &#8220;An
apple grows on a tree&#8221;, is something that does convey a bit of
knowledge.

<!--l. 217--><p class="noindent" >Knowledge is another one of those big words that has a lot of debate
around it. Speaking plainly knowledge generally refers to what people
have experienced before. When you know a person, then you have met
them before, or interacted with them. If you remember personal details
they shared about themselves, then could say you know them
personally.
</p><!--l. 224--><p class="indent" >   Now we get to a distinction between personal knowledge, and shared
knowledge. For example facts are a part of shared knowledge, which
brings us to the topic of reality.

<!--l. 230--><p class="noindent" >Real is the group of beliefs held in common amongst a group of people.
Objective reality includes objects, such as rocks, plants, animals, planets
as people with beliefs.
</p><!--l. 234--><p class="indent" >   So while a group of homo-sapiens may share the belief that the Earth
is flat, this does not change the beliefs the planet and galaxy cosmos it is
nested within holds.
</p><!--l. 238--><p class="indent" >   Importantly facts are elements of the real. To claim something to be
real or a fact it must be verifiable.
</p><!--l. 241--><p class="indent" >   For example if you claim to have gone swimming in a frozen lake, and
your friends asks &#8220;is that a fact?&#8221;, then you can show them the video you
took, for an objective reality verification, or your other friend that was
there could corroborate.
</p><!--l. 246--><p class="indent" >   There can be things that may be objectively real, but difficult to
verify, such as past lives on different planets. Generally for difficult to
verify claims, it is better for the claimer to lower their claim status from
real to a personal truth.

Buddhism[<tspan font-family="ecbx" font-size="1000">9780316726436</tspan>], materialist scientists often have a dualistic
world view, where macroscopic things are based on Newtonian
Mechanics, but at the quantum level they agree that the observer and
the observer are intrinsically interrelated.
</p><!--l. 264--><p class="indent" >   In particular the separation of mind and matter is called dualism, as
it separates creation into two. However, there are a variety of problems
with this view, including that there is no way that mind and matter
could interact if they were separate, it violates the laws of physics,
doesn&#8217;t make sense in biology, and is an overly complicated way of
looking at the world.
</p><!--l. 270--><p class="indent" >   While dualism can be an interesting thought experiment, for mind

mind that is the whole, and thus idealism is correct. There are a
few varieties of idealism, like Advaita Vedanta of Hinduism, and
Yogachara of Buddhism, Neoplatonism of Ancient Greece, though the
main one popular in science and compatible with quantum and
classical physics is pluralistic idealism. Again there are several
varieties of pluralistic idealism, in this book is a form that seems to
work.
</p><!--l. 288--><p class="indent" >   The physical world we experience with our senses, is us observing the
communication of a large variety of belief holders (atoms inclusive),
mostly through what we in physics term bosons, which include photons
also known as light particles.
</p><!--l. 293--><p class="indent" >   Even with &#8220;solid&#8221; things like an atom, which is considered fermionic
and thus different from bosons, they don&#8217;t actually &#8216;touch&#8217; each other,
even during nuclear fusion. Instead, they communicate to each other
with bosons giving each other space, much as how it is difficult to
push two magnets together who have their south poles facing
each other. Another example is gluons which are a type of bosons
that is the communication used to keep protons and neutrons
together.
</p><!--l. 300--><p class="indent" >   Incarnation is like a car rental, we are souls in the soul world, and we
want to play this fun game, called Galaxy Cosmos, the Greeks called this
game Sophia. So we are within the Sophia galaxy cosmos, and are
incarnated on Gaia, borrowing some of her atoms to maintain the bodies
our parents nurtured into the world.
</p><!--l. 306--><p class="indent" >   According to Integrated information theory, every proton has a
semblance of consciousness because it is able to preserve state and
communicate. For example an atom can have an energy level, and it can
communicate with photons. When you send it a photon, it reflects it
back, saying &#8220;I am here, this is my color.&#8221; Though that is a gross
oversimplification as it has much more complicated communication
depending on a large variety of factors.

<!--l. 317--><p class="noindent" >Science, and particularly the natural sciences are focused on discovering
what mineral and DNA based life forms believe.
</p><!--l. 320--><p class="indent" >   However, science is more generic than that, and is actually more
closely aligned to a specific method of inquiry known as the &#8220;Scientific
Method.&#8221;
</p><!--l. 323--><p class="indent" >   In brief in the scientific method a person comes up with a hypothesis.
These usually come in two forms, the Null Hypothesis, or the If-Then
hypothesis.
</p><!--l. 326--><p class="indent" >   The Null hypothesis states that two things are unrelated. For
example &#8220;What a person remembers as their past lives does not influence
their present life.&#8221;
</p><!--l. 329--><p class="indent" >   An If-Then hypothesis states that there is a causal connection
between two things. For example &#8220;If a person is hypnotically regressed to
a time before they were born then they will experience either their past
lives or the soul world.&#8221;
</p><!--l. 333--><p class="indent" >   Then one comes up with an experiment to test the hypothesis. Such
as hypnotically regressing a bunch of people to a time before they were
born. Though ideally would also have some kind of control group, such
as a group of people that were asked to make up a story about someone
from the same time period.
</p><!--l. 339--><p class="indent" >   When someone says &#8220;scientists agree&#8221;, or &#8220;science has shown us that&#8221;,
typically they are referring to some studies that have been accepted as
valid by at least some group of people.
</p><!--l. 343--><p class="indent" >   Notably there is a fairly strong group of materialists amongst
scientists, in a way they have a world of their own.

<!--l. 347--><p class="noindent" >A world can be considered to be a particular group of people that share
                                                        
                                                        
certain beliefs, and that keep those beliefs alive orbiting each other,
much like a planet.
</p><!--l. 351--><p class="indent" >   So for instance Buddhism is a world of belief that was started on this
planet by Gautama, though he himself carried it over from another
planet that he had lived on. And even after he left the Buddhist world
lives on.
</p><!--l. 355--><p class="indent" >   These worlds are self-reinforcing and often it&#8217;s members can blindly
disregard evidence to the contrary of their world beliefs, in order to
support the group. This can be seen amongst religious groups, political
groups,
</p><!--l. 359--><p class="indent" >   At this time one of the world groups that hold the most influence at

materialism.

<!--l. 364--><p class="noindent" >Sceptics and disbelievers in general all serve a purpose, they add
diversity to creation.
</p><!--l. 367--><p class="indent" >   The Materialist faith, and that of the one-lifers is one that has
been around for thousands of years. It is useful for some kinds of
lessons to focus on just this one life, and the champion sceptics
that promote the one-life belief systems are helping to create an
environment where it is easier to forget about the soul world and past
lives.
</p><!--l. 373--><p class="indent" >   A world where it&#8217;s easier to focus on the present, particularly for
those that have trouble in this regard.
</p><!--l. 376--><p class="indent" >   The important thing is to cultivate respect, love and understanding.
Recognize that the sceptics and disbelievers are providing a valuable
service, by allowing people to have choices about which world they wish
to live in.
</p><!--l. 380--><p class="indent" >   Similarly, by giving others the freedom to have their worlds
of beliefs, we deserve to have the freedom of our own world of
                                                        
                                                        
belief.
</p><!--l. 383--><p class="indent" >   The materialist faith is not the only one, and there are many science
experiments that disprove it&#8217;s tenents. Though just as with any world,
the believers disregard evidence to the contrary.
</p><!--l. 387--><p class="indent" >   Green Buddhism however is not materialist, instead it is monist but
with the flavour that all is mind or information. Let&#8217;s have a look at the
physics of information.
</p><!--l. 391--><p class="noindent" >
</p>
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">9.2.15   </span> <a 
 id="x1-770009.2.15"></a>Entropy</h4>
<!--l. 392--><p class="noindent" >In the second law of thermodynamics it states that entropy is always
increasing. Entropy is the name for the energy that is lost or the &#8220;waste
heat&#8221; that is created in most physical process.
</p><!--l. 396--><p class="indent" >   Information theory uses the word similarly, Shannon was famously
looking for a word to describe the &#8220;missing information&#8221; lost during
communication, when von Neumann suggested calling it entropy as it
was the most similar concept.[[<tspan font-family="ecbx" font-size="1000">9812384006</tspan>]]
</p><!--l. 401--><p class="indent" >   If we look deep into physics we find that matter is made up of atoms,
which in turn are small entities that communicate to each other through
little information packets called bosons. A photon or light particle is an
example of a boson.
</p><!--l. 406--><p class="indent" >   So when you are holding a rock, what is really happening, is that the
atoms in your hand, are communicating to the atoms in the rock, and
informing each other about their location, and also saying &#8220;okay,
that&#8217;s close enough&#8221;, it takes a lot of pressure to make atoms
move closer together, since just like a majority of people, they
don&#8217;t like it when they are being squeezed by a crowd. Different
atoms though have different preferences, some like flourine always
want to attach to someone, and metals are fairly good at sticking
together.
</p><!--l. 414--><p class="indent" >   Now someone might complain that I&#8217;m anthropomorphizing here,
saying that flourine wants something. However, as we&#8217;ll cover later,
                                                        
                                                        
wanting or desire is not born of choice like a wish but rather a
preprogrammed response, as are animal and plant instincts. In that
regard it is appropriate to say an atom wants.
</p><!--l. 419--><p class="indent" >   In fact, with Integrated Information Theory (IIT) we know that
atoms not only want, but they also have a semblance of consciousness.
IIT says that even a single proton, which is the simplest form of atom,
has consciousness. To analyze whether something has consciousness there
are a variety of factors involved, however to simplify it is any system
that has inputs, outputs and state.
</p><!--l. 425--><p class="indent" >   So for instance the atom has a state of its current energy, it can
receive a photon from the sun, absorb some of its information,
and produce a different photon which has a colour representing
itself.
</p><!--l. 429--><p class="indent" >   In this way we know that our bodies are made entirely of conscious
beings, the atoms, the cells, perhaps some organs, and then the body
which you&#8217;ve incarnated into, providing the wisdom and intelligence
of your many lifetimes, even if you aren&#8217;t consciously aware of
them.
</p><!--l. 434--><p class="indent" >   Going back to entropy we know that the &#8220;waste heat&#8221; is made of
information packets.
</p><!--l. 437--><p class="indent" >   Information Theory reformulated the second law of thermodynamics
as saying that information can not be destroyed. So given an example of
a simple classical computing logic gate, where you have two input bits,
and one output bit, there is some lost information. That lost information
is not lost to creation, instead it escapes as a heat based information
packet.
</p><!--l. 443--><p class="indent" >   It is also possible to create a reversible logic gate where there is no
loss, such as a controlled flip (Toffoli) or a controlled swap (Fredkin)
gate, they have three inputs and three outputs, allowing you to
reconstruct the input from the output, and these kinds of gates
could theoretically achieve zero heat generation, and certainly no
information loss, which goes to show that entropy is really lost
information.
</p><!--l. 450--><p class="indent" >   What lost information is brings us to the discussion of soul.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">9.2.16   </span> <a 
 id="x1-780009.2.16"></a>Soul</h4>
<!--l. 454--><p class="noindent" >Buddhism and theologians in particular can be rather finicky with
words. A Theologian once scolded me for using the words soul and
reincarnation in a Buddhist context because Buddhism has its own
synonyms for those, because there are some fine philosophical
distinctions. Though for this text the distinction between reincarnation
and rebirth, as well as mindstream and soul are without merit, and
would only serve to confuse readers. Also in case this makes your
academic mind very concerned I will cover the Buddhist points of
distinction in Chapter 7<a 
href="#x1-16400015">15<!--tex4ht:ref: chapter7 --></a>.
</p><!--l. 463--><p class="indent" >   To simplify the matter for those that are unaware, the main objection
early Buddhists had to the idea of soul, was that it was considered
independent and unchangeable, which contradicts the facts that things
are continuously changing, and &#8216;emptiness&#8217; which is better understood as
&#8216;all is one&#8217;.
</p><!--l. 468--><p class="indent" >   Interestingly Buddhism kept reincarnation, karma and all the other
things, and instead renamed soul as mindstream, which is basically a
changeable version of soul, which is not as independent.
</p><!--l. 472--><p class="indent" >   Since the majority of the world still uses the word soul for
the concept, we&#8217;ll be using the world soul in this text, with the
understanding that it is actually a collection of knowledge, and that as
we learn, that knowledge transforms.
</p><!--l. 477--><p class="indent" >   This is directly derivable from the second law of
thermodynamics, that information can not be destroyed. This
is known in quantum information theory as the no-delete
theorem[<tspan font-family="ecbx" font-size="1000">QuantumnodeletingtheoremWikipedia-2018-10-01</tspan>].
</p><!--l. 481--><p class="indent" >   So at the dissolution of a host-body such as the vehicle you are
using now, all the knowledge and perspective you have acquired
must continue. The knowledge also can&#8217;t break down into their
base elements as that would be simplifying things and thus losing
information.
</p><!--l. 486--><p class="indent" >   What information theory tells us is that the information can only be
moved somewhere else, in the case of the information that is in our
                                                        
                                                        
minds at the end of life, the location it moves to is typically the soul
world.
</p><!--l. 490--><p class="indent" >   Interestingly we do have quite a bit of empirical research available on
the soul world, what it looks like, and how it functions, largely thanks to
the Hypnotic Regressions conducted by the Newton Institute, though
there is also corroboration from the work of other hypnotic regression
researchers such as Dolores Cannon.
</p><!--l. 496--><p class="indent" >   To limit the length of this chapter we&#8217;ll cover the soul world in more
depth in Chapter 9 (<a 
href="#x1-19600017">17<!--tex4ht:ref: chapter9 --></a>).
</p><!--l. 499--><p class="indent" >   Of course to some materialists I&#8217;ve just said some things which may
have made them flustered. In particular using hypnotic regression as
method of inquiry to delve into the nature of reality. However, as we&#8217;ve
already learned that the results of those hypnotic regressions are simply
the truth of those people.
</p><!--l. 504--><p class="indent" >   Humans are often used as the subjects of scientific experiments, and
before the advent of video cameras and audio recorders they were also
responsible for seeing and hearing the results of the experiments.
Currently we do not have a technological means of delving into the soul
world, but we do have humans almost all of whom have the ability
during hypnosis.
</p><!--l. 510--><p class="indent" >   Some Buddhists may also be confused how this relates to Buddhism,
so we need at least one more subsection in this introduction, on how
hypnosis and guided meditation are synonymous.
</p><!--l. 514--><p class="noindent" >
</p>
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">9.2.17   </span> <a 
 id="x1-790009.2.17"></a>Guided Meditation or Hypnosis</h4>
<!--l. 515--><p class="noindent" >For many beginners the easiest introduction to meditation is known as
guided meditation. It is where a teacher or recording of a teacher guides
you through the steps of relaxing your body and suggests ways of
performing the meditation.
</p><!--l. 519--><p class="indent" >   What is less talked about is that this is exactly the same process by
which hypnosis occurs. Where the hypnotist guides you through relaxing
                                                        
                                                        
and then gives some suggestions of what to think about.
</p><!--l. 523--><p class="indent" >   While it&#8217;s possible to call meditation self-hypnosis, and to call
hypnosis guided-meditation, why use two words when one explains it?
Probably just for marketing purposes.
</p><!--l. 527--><p class="indent" >   However, when you realize that guided meditation is hypnosis, then
you can combine all the knowledge we have from both labels and have
greater awareness of what is going on and how to accomplish
it.
</p><!--l. 531--><p class="indent" >   The main distinction is that meditation is an active self-guided
processes, wheras hypnosis is a passive external-guided process. So for
example under hypnosis you won&#8217;t need to use the executive function
parts of your brain nearly as much as in ordinary meditation.
</p><!--l. 536--><p class="indent" >   The important thing for now is to understand that while first person
meditation can be used for personal introspection, every tool has a
degree of error in its perception. Humans are known to have a
fairly high degree of error in terms of witness testimony, as we
mentioned earlier, because of a tendency of filling gaps in knowledge
automatically.
</p><!--l. 542--><p class="indent" >   Hypnosis allows us to use humans as tools for viewing the soul
world in a standardized fashion. This way can regress tens or
hundreds of humans to the time between their past lives, and thus
take out much of the filler, and just get at the content of the soul
world.
</p><!--l. 547--><p class="indent" >   In fact this has already been done and accomplished by David
Newton and the Newton Institute. Can read his books &#8220;Journey of Souls&#8221;
and &#8220;Destiny of Souls&#8221; for his personal research, and the Newton
Institute also has ongoing periodical of updates based on their latest
findings.

missing fingers occupied him for the rest of his time with me till he
passed me off to a sherpa.
</p><!--l. 638--><p class="indent" >   I think that if I had been kinder to Affa, learned his real name and

mountains.
</p><!--l. 646--><p class="indent" >   He seemed sceptical, though I didn&#8217;t quite understand what they
were saying it went something like. &#8220;Are you serious?&#8221; asked the Sherpa
somewhat aghast.
</p><!--l. 649--><p class="indent" >   At which point Affa raised his maimed and bandage hand and with

life.
</p><!--l. 654--><p class="indent" >   In those rocky mountain areas we just had a pack mule and were
otherwise on foot.
</p><!--l. 656--><p class="indent" >   Throughout it all I had been carrying my sword, which I had to wrap
in cloth and carry on my back, so as not to &#8220;cause trouble&#8221;, attract
thieves, or start an incident. As we got higher into the mountains, the
                                                        
                                                        
people got smaller, the going got harder, everything was colder, and I
was a lot hungrier.
</p><!--l. 661--><p class="indent" >   As we were approaching Guge (ancient western Tibet), my guide
started to get ancy, but I told him unless he could find me another guide
he&#8217;d have to take me all the way to my destination. Used some threats,
but I think mostly he kept on with me as he did not want to give the
burden of me onto anyone else.
</p><!--l. 666--><p class="indent" >   About the prowess of his own people that had led to me coming
along this journey. So in a way he accepted full responsibility for
what he had said. An exemplary man, whom I hold in the highest
regard.
</p><!--l. 670--><p class="indent" >   For a long time we walked on the Tibetan plateau. At times, we
would stop to resupply and I would ask if we were close. He would nod
and say that we will get there.
</p><!--l. 674--><p class="indent" >   At various huts along the way, he had a way of convincing them to
let us stay. I always slept with my sword in hand at my bedside. At
night, he would sleep sitting up outside my door, and warn away people
lest they wake me. &#8220;he will as soon rise as slice you in half&#8221; the sherpa
would mutter.
</p><!--l. 680--><p class="indent" >   At times, we stopped by the houses of holy people. One memorable
one was a man with a black flowing outfit with gold trim. Presumably a
man of some importance. The Sherpa and he talked for a while at the
dinner table after I retired to bed.
</p><!--l. 685--><p class="indent" >   One time we were making our way across the plateau. It was a hazy
day, and I was using my sword as a walking stick by this point, when a
boy ran up to us. Though he was small as many of the other
locals, I had a newfound respect for these small people, as they
could run in the thin air, and they did not seem to tire as easily.
Wheras I always felt weak and tired, struggling with the rarefied
air.
</p><!--l. 692--><p class="indent" >   The Sherpa and the boy talked for a little while and then the boy ran
off. I asked what it was about, he gave me a weary glance and said &#8220;we&#8217;re
close, they&#8217;ll be expecting us.&#8221; I was too tired to pry into the deeper
meaning behind that.
</p><!--l. 697--><p class="indent" >   Eventually frostnipped and hagard we reached a fortified town of
                                                        
                                                        
Guge. The fog made it, so we could not see it until we were within a few
hundred meters. The walls had a red border, and archers lined them.
There was a small troop with shields and sticks guarding the entrance.
They were expecting us.
</p><!--l. 702--><p class="indent" >   A wagon was approaching the town, with a few women onboard. A
man in an ornate silk jacket with gold trim standing between the troop
and the wagon seemed to be the town leader.
</p><!--l. 706--><p class="indent" >   I took a moment to take this all in, I looked around and noticed that
my Sherpa had hung back to my right, and was several meters
away. He nodded his head towards the fortress, &#8220;we&#8217;re here&#8221; he
projected his voice. Watching me wearily, to see what I would
do.
</p><!--l. 711--><p class="indent" >   Turning back to the fortress, leaning on my sword, I had mentally
rehearsed for this moment for a while. I would challenge their gods in
battle, and after defeating them, I would be a god myself. At least
that was my plan, for if one kills a god, then is one not a least as
mighty?
</p><!--l. 716--><p class="indent" >   With my remaining strength, I threw off my robes, raised my sword
with one arm into the air and yelled &#8220;Let me see your gods, I will defeat
them!.&#8221; The hail of arrows pierced me in a dozen places shortly therafter,
while my arm was still raised.
</p><!--l. 721--><p class="indent" >   I collapsed forward, and the last thing I saw was a woman in the
wagon staring at me in shock, and the leader walking towards me in his
silk and gold, a young Khor-re perhaps.
</p><!--l. 725--><p class="noindent" >                                                    <object data="green_buddhism-3.svg" width="24.18723 " height="24.1872 " type="image/svg+xml"><p>SVG-Viewer needed.</p></object>
<!--l. 727--><p class="indent" >   The Sherpa was a good man, even if he led me into a trap, he did
right by his people. He had gotten out of the way just in time to avoid
the hail of arrows. My guide into the land of Dharma was a realized man
himself.
</p><!--l. 731--><p class="indent" >   I sacrificed my life and all I had in pursuit of the teaching (Dharma),
even if I was confused about how it worked and what it was. In between

</p><!--l. 3--><p class="indent" >   I found a nice long stick, I raised it up above my head and yelled &#8220;I

they tripped and I managed to catch up.
</p><!--l. 7--><p class="indent" >   On the floor they tried to block me with their arms and legs, hiding a

</p><!--l. 12--><p class="indent" >   I raised my stick for another blow but it was stuck, I looked up and it
was an adult hand, a man. I let go and ran around to kick them in their

it.

</p><!--l. 24--><p class="indent" >   He became still for a while, and I noticed his grip on my head loosen.
He seemed to be deep in thought. Though still angry I was also curious
what had changed. He got down to my level and held both my upper
arms in his hands. He looked me in the eyes. He seemed to confirm his
suspicion.
</p><!--l. 29--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;It has been a long time since I&#8217;ve heard someone talk like that.&#8221; he
smiled at me. &#8220;There was a giant that died in our land a few years ago.
                                                        
                                                        
His guide told me that was how he talked. So you really want to be a

is no place for violence in our court&#8221; and &#8220;he must go to study if he is to

before too long at around age 5 or 6 I was on a cart going to my new
home.

<!--l. 51--><p class="indent" >   My new home was small, it was barely a shack, the home of a
Ngagpa, his wife and two kids, where I was the unwanted guest. Inside it
had little more than a fireplace and a single bed where the family slept, I
slept on a rug near their their bed.
</p><!--l. 56--><p class="indent" >   Initially I got to stay in the family home in the day and played with
the kids, but the mother considered me a bad influence, so fairly
early on the pattern shifted to breakfast and morning lessons with
the ngagpa, and then I would leave to sit and chant on a nearby
mountainside. The reasoning was that I was not there to learn to be a
farmer, but was there exclusively to learn the teachings the Ngagpa
had.
</p><!--l. 63--><p class="indent" >   Since I was away so long I&#8217;d come back only as the sun was setting,
after dinner was served, so I&#8217;d go straight to bed. I used to feast in the
morning grabbing everything I could and shoving it in my mouth, but
                                                        
                                                        
the mother didn&#8217;t like it, and I felt shamed into eating only as much as
the other children at breakfast.
</p><!--l. 68--><p class="indent" >   From eating only one meal a day my growth was stunted. I remember
one year when the leader came to visit on the cart and bring
supplies, he was furious to see how thin and emaciated I was,
while the ngagpa&#8217;s children were fat by comparison. I defended
them saying it was my choice to come here and learn to be a
Ngagpa, though afterward the mother did let me eat more at
breakfast, so as not to incur the wrath of the leader at a later
visit.
</p><!--l. 75--><p class="indent" >   I had many lessons but I&#8217;ll go into those in sections where they are
more appropriate.
</p><!--l. 78--><p class="indent" >   One of the main lessons was learning the Vajra Guru mantra, and
that if I wanted to be like the venerable diety Padmasambhava that I
should chant it seven million times. Learning of this I was very excited
and spent all afternoon chanting, then came back and said I had done it.
He said I didn&#8217;t, and gave me a lesson in how to count with prayer
beads. One mala bead for each recitation, and there were only 108 beads
on a necklace. After a while I understood the enormity of the task, and
continued on with the beads. I eventually made my own prayer beada
necklace with chicken bones.
</p><!--l. 87--><p class="indent" >   My visit to a Samye monastary was one of the best bonding times I
had with my ngagpa teacher. Our journey took several months so we had
many opportunities to speak, and get as much information out of him as
I could. As pilgrims we hitched many rides along the trade route to
Lhasa It was definitely the largest pilgrimage I took in that lifetime, and
at least in time the longest I&#8217;ve taken in a religious context during my
time on Earth. I remember once we had come over a hill and
were overlooking Samye Monastary, it was a beautiful sight, just
speechless.
</p><!--l. 96--><p class="indent" >   The legendary monastary of Padmasambhava, whose vajra guru
mantra we recited daily for years. All the stories and accomplishments
revolved around this place. If you are a follower of Nyingma Buddhism,
the Samye Monastary can be a worthwhile place to visit at least once
during your time on Earth.
                                                        
                                                        
</p><!--l. 101--><p class="indent" >   One of the main things this life did for me is that it gave me a lot of
practice living a virtuous life, with relatively little temptation.
</p>
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">10.1   </span> <a 
 id="x1-8500010.1"></a>Virtue/Vinaya/Precepts</h3>
<!--l. 106--><p class="noindent" >The main reason to follow the virtues is so you can have a more pleasant
life. The basis of all virtue is the Golden Rule &#8220;to others as to
yourself&#8221;.
</p><!--l. 109--><p class="indent" >   The basic idea behind the golden rule is that if you commit
some unvirtuous action such as stealing, then stealing becomes
more likely to occur in your experience, and so you may end up
being the one stolen from. For instance when you are caught (and
remember everything is alive and observing), then your time and
freedom may be stolen for a while, you may even end up having to
live with other thieves who would steal various things from you.
This is all simply to help you learn what it feels like to be on
both sides of an action, helping you to be a more well rounded
person.
</p><!--l. 118--><p class="indent" >   The corollary of this idea is that if you want to increase how many
incarnations you have surrounded by unvirtuous people, then you can
increase how many unvirtuous actions you commit. This path of
unvirtuous action can be taken by the Easy Path, since they are not
interested in progress. The Selfish Path benefits from virtuous action
whenever possible, because it lowers karmic binding and thus opens up
the number of options that the person has. For the Generous Path
virtuous action is fairly mandatory to help avoid hurting others by
accident.
</p><!--l. 127--><p class="indent" >   As a gentle reminder Earth is becoming a Generous Planet so
Generous Path people get priority for incarnating here.
</p><!--l. 130--><p class="indent" >   The Vinaya as part of the Pali Cannon has hundreds of precepts or
rules that a fully ordained monk must follow. There are eight which a
novice monk or a fasting holiday practitioner aims to follow. And five
which a lay practitioner is recommended to follow.
</p><!--l. 135--><p class="indent" >   It is important to note that this list was compiled thousands of years
                                                        
                                                        
ago, based on the life of Gautama Buddha and the challenges that he
and his monks faced at the time.
</p><!--l. 139--><p class="indent" >   Also important to note is that before the Gautama died he said
that the &#8220;unimportant&#8221; precepts could be ignored, though no one
could ever agree which were the unimportant ones, so all were
preserved.
</p><!--l. 143--><p class="indent" >   I see Buddhism as an offshoot of Hinduism, perhaps one of the most
successful independent branches. For a while Buddhism was the main
faith in India, though at some point it began to stagnate, and other
forms of Hinduism were more innovative and eventually Buddhism all
but disappeared from India.
</p><!--l. 148--><p class="indent" >   One thing that I&#8217;ve found is that while Buddhism has many precepts
for monks, Hinduism and Yoga has a fairly complete set of Yamas and
Niyamas which are good for all. So I&#8217;ve decided to combine the Buddhist
and Hindu virtues for a better overview.

<!--l. 192--><p class="noindent" >This one as phrased in the original of breathing beings, is not really
workable considering that we now know that plants, and fungi also
respire or breathe. Also we know that fundamentally everything is
alive.
</p><!--l. 196--><p class="indent" >   Instead I&#8217;ve come up with a rough formula to help with accounting
how much benefit we create and consume. <tspan font-family="cmmi" font-size="10">a</tspan><sup><tspan font-family="cmmi" font-size="7">d</tspan></sup> or amount raisesd to the
power of it&#8217;s spiritual density. For example mineral life forms are
spiritual density 1, plants are 2.0 until 2.5 and animals are 2.5 until 3.0,
human-level beings are 3.0 until 4.0.
</p><!--l. 202--><p class="indent" >   So that motivates one to consume mineral and plants in preference to
more costly things. Obviously I discourage consuming people, though the
fact remains that some people receive blood or organs from other
people.
</p><!--l. 206--><p class="indent" >   Additionally to maintainging a primarily vegan lifestyle, it is also
good to keep it as peaceful as possible. When you pluck a leaf to eat,
do so gently thanking the plant. This goes back to the way of
how animist hunter-gatherers used to thank an animal or tree for
giving it&#8217;s life to allow the hunter-gatherer and their family to
live.
</p><!--l. 212--><p class="indent" >   Of course just as your are gentle with the mineral, plant and animal
life forms, so to should also be gentle with humans. Remember that the
higher the development of a being, the more important it is to be
peaceful (non-violent) with them. Though since all are alive, even a grain
of sand deserves respect.
</p><!--l. 217--><p class="indent" >   Note that as with all virtues should practice Satya with Ahimsa, so
                                                        
                                                        
abstain from thinking about commiting violence, abstain from talking
about commiting violence, and abstain from actually commiting
violence.
</p><!--l. 222--><p class="indent" >   In contemporary living that would include playing violent video
games.
</p><!--l. 224--><p class="indent" >   Notably there are some historical Buddhist dieties (Dorje Shugden
which promotes schisms and hate crimes) and proverbs that promote
violence or even murder (killing Buddhas &#8216;figuratively&#8217;), however those
are not acceptable within Green Buddhism. Even if it is a joke, or a
figurative expression, it is still shameful to call those valid teachings
because they are clear violators of virtue.
</p><!--l. 231--><p class="indent" >   Violence is something that is best limited to an educational context,
of learning about history, politics, and self-defense.
</p><!--l. 234--><p class="indent" >   Gautama was a pacifist and did not believe in self-defense which on a
personal level is acceptable in a peaceful nation with an effective police
force.
</p><!--l. 237--><p class="indent" >   However, at the larger scale Buddhist nations have been overthrown
and forcibly converted by Islam on numerous occasions. So self-defense is
essential for the survival Buddhist nations, and Buddhist persons in
hostile territory. I do talk about when absolute pacifism does make sense
in some later chapters, though I&#8217;d consider that a relatively advanced
skill.
</p><!--l. 243--><p class="indent" >   Kung Fu is a Buddhist martial art and like most martial arts can be
considered good exercise when not being used for self-defense.
</p><!--l. 246--><p class="indent" >   One exercise in Ahimsa you can do, particularly if you are a mix of
Buddhism and one of the Abrhamic faiths, is you can take some time to
redact the verses of violence from your personal versions of the torah,
bible, quran and hadith. Hinduism and many other faiths have their own
redactable verses of violence. As I mentioned even some forms of
Buddhism have verses with &#8220;figurative violence&#8221; which can also be
redacted.
</p><!--l. 253--><p class="indent" >   There are so many verses of violence, that to save you the
hassle some of the most common are in the violent verses appendix
(<a 
href="#x1-22400024">24<!--tex4ht:ref: violentVerses --></a>). Recall that the ones being redacted aren&#8217;t simply the verses
that describe unfortunate acts of violence, but rather the ones
                                                        
                                                        
that prescribe predatory violence, or have led to the deaths of
many people because they are interpreted in to support predatory
violence.
</p><!--l. 260--><p class="indent" >   The takeaway here is that because everything is alive including the
atoms that make up all matter, everything deserves gentleness and
non-violent interaction when possible. However to maintain a host-body
or a civilization, sometimes it is necessary to mine for minerals, and kill
plants to use as food. Thus the best way to observe Ahimsa is
to minimize the amount of harm, and maximize the amount of
benefit.
</p><!--l. 267--><p class="indent" >   For example if you need to eat plants to eat, then you can also help
plants grow. Or benefit creation in another way, to make up for the
inevitable harm that simply being alive causes.

<!--l. 273--><p class="noindent" >Asteya generally refers to abstain from stealing, in particular the petty
kind, such as stealing bread from the baker, or jewels from a person.
This is something everyone is familiar with, and is something important
to avoid. Even if for no other reason then that you don&#8217;t want accrue the
karma to have your things stolen.
</p><!--l. 279--><p class="indent" >   To really understand the respect portion of the reformulated precept
we have to understand what is meant by respect. By respect I mean a
force that pushes two atoms apart, giving each their own space so they
can function in a healthy way.
</p><!--l. 283--><p class="indent" >   In this life I had a relationship where I had a lot of physical contact
with my partner. When she was leaving me she said that while I loved
her, I didn&#8217;t respect her. It&#8217;s true, by taking the physical things I wanted
from her when I wanted them, I was not giving her the space to be
herself.
</p><!--l. 288--><p class="indent" >   It is the same way with the mother earth or Gaia, she has many gifts,
though we should respect her, and not take too much. Lately humanity
                                                        
                                                        
has been burning a lot of fossil fuels which has been increasing the
carbon dioxide levels at a rather quick rate. While some extra carbon
dioxide in the air is good as it can avert another glaciation period, it is
good to do such things in moderation. If we could set a long term target
to avoid another glaciation period 50,000 years from now by the
milankovich cycle, then we could set a good budget to keep the climate
fairly even.
</p><!--l. 297--><p class="indent" >   By giving each other the respect and thus the room and freedom to
express ourselves and be ourselves, allows for a greater diversity.
</p><!--l. 300--><p class="indent" >   Currently large cities are much like stars, where many single
people (hydrogen atoms) are pushed together into small spaces
and some fuse to form nuclear families (helium). Occasionally
these families escape from the big cities and move to more rural
areas where there is more room for their children to grow and
flourish.
</p><!--l. 306--><p class="indent" >   Theoretically if our cities get large enough and old enough, and
our people live long enough (or remember their past lives), then
the cities may run out of single people, and we&#8217;d start getting
larger groups of people fusing together, up to around iron (isotope
56).
</p><!--l. 311--><p class="indent" >   Happiness is generally inversely proportional to population density
because homo sapiens evolved to live in relatively small groups of 50 to
60, and with groups larger than 200 some people are anonymous, in
that they don&#8217;t know or aren&#8217;t known by everyone else in the
group.
</p><!--l. 316--><p class="indent" >   Ideally we should be able to form such small hamlets in rural areas as
we lower our dependence on brick and mortar stores, and buy most
things through the internet and receive them by mail. Currently zoning
still stands in the way of such communities, but together we may be able
to find some places to make it work.
</p><!--l. 322--><p class="indent" >   By giving communities, municipalities and nations the respect to try
something new, to set their own policies, we can increase our adaptive
capacity, and do real political science, to find which policies work best

<!--l. 328--><p class="noindent" >There is a buddhist precept that encourages one to abstain from sexual
misconduct. Though what that means can be fairly fluid depending on
context.
</p><!--l. 331--><p class="indent" >   For instance for a Gelug monastic it generally means complete
chastity. Wheras many other schools of Buddhism from Nyingma to Zen
allow and at times even encourage marriage. In modern day even
many Gelug tulku&#8217;s have been marrying, such as Zasep Tulku
Rinpoche.
</p><!--l. 336--><p class="indent" >   The main thing in a relationship is not who you have it with, but
that you are both empathetic to each other. That there is full consent for
what occurs, including any sexuality.
</p><!--l. 340--><p class="indent" >   On another level Brahmacharya is also about the moderation of
sensuality, because it recognizes that the lower parts of our brain or
chakras sometimes can never get enough, so such urges for food,
sexuality, trivia, novelty or otherwise should be meditated on,
researched, communicated and understood. This way can find if there is
perhaps a nutritional, spiritual or intellectual deficit which can be
resolved to modulate these feelings.
</p><!--l. 347--><p class="indent" >   For example I am a vegan and like to do physical and mental
exercise, for the past few months or perhaps even years I had
been feeling tired much of the time, which led me to taking lots
of naps, simply to get through the day. I felt hungry for high
energy foods such as fats. I had done meditation on it, but didn&#8217;t
really come up with much. I had a blood test done and found
out I was low on creatine, which is beneficial for allowing the
body to produce energy. After I started supplementing creatine I
started feeling energized and no longer nearly as tired as I had
before.
</p><!--l. 356--><p class="indent" >   For completeness lets include a definition of love from a logical
perspective. Love is when one copies the attributes of another so that
they have more in common. For example if someone tells you something
and you remember it, then that is a form of love. In terms we have used
                                                        
                                                        
before it would be accepting someones truth as your own beliefs, and
thus increasing the shared reality. So if you imagine two circles in a
venn diagram, love increases the overlap. Another example of love
would be doing things together, since that would also increase
overlap.

<!--l. 396--><p class="noindent" >Children should never be forced to fast, because they are still growing
and it could stunt their growth. Technically human brains are still
developing till the age of 25, and bodies till the age of 30. Once children
are weaned they often sleep 12 hours a night which is equivalent to a
fast, so a 12 hour fast sleep inclusive is appropriate. 12 hours is also the
duration of time it takes for food to fully traverse the intestinal track,
so giving that kind of time can help maintain healthy intestinal
health.
</p><!--l. 404--><p class="indent" >   After the age of 30 fasting becomes more acceptable and fasting 12 or
more hours a day is recommended. Gautama Buddha recommended and
Theraveda recommends fasting 18 hours a day, with breakfast and lunch
being the primary meals. For Gautama Buddha and the Theravedan
monks that receive alms the logic was thata they would make their
rounds to collect food in the morning, and would return to their abode
to eat breakfast, then if there were leftovers from breakfast they would
finish them at lunch.
</p><!--l. 412--><p class="indent" >   In modern western life however usually the easiest time to eat is after
getting home from work. It may also make most sense from the

eat.
</p><!--l. 417--><p class="indent" >   Personally I prefer to skip breakfast because the best cognitive

account for inflation the fund would have to grow probably between 1
and 2% per year in addition to giving it&#8217;s payout, so likely would have to
be somewhat larger.

</p><!--l. 460--><p class="indent" >   For instance two and a half million dollars would be enough to make

</p><!--l. 463--><p class="indent" >   If you join a community that has such a generous tenure share,
then you could save 40% of your income, and in 20 years have
enough saved up to go independent if you wished. Another option
would be if a community want to have a child, then they would
want to create a new tenure share for them, as a single parent it
would take 20 years, but as a couple it would take 10 years, and
if all grandparents or four additional community members are
contributing then only about 3 and a half years. With 12 members
working together could create a new tenure share every year and a
half.
</p><!--l. 472--><p class="indent" >   Imagine being raised in a community so loving that when you come

</p><!--l. 476--><p class="indent" >   Of course community atoms can also make even more money by
providing products and services to the greater community. The tenure
shares are there to allow them to do as much research as necessary, and
to allow them to work at their cognitive optimal by not having to worry
about basic income. It also means they don&#8217;t have to sacrifice their
values to make ends meet, and don&#8217;t have to take bad deals just because
of the money.
</p><!--l. 483--><p class="indent" >   Atoms as you may know can join together to form molecules,
though based on my understanding there are extroverted and
introverted parts of an atom, the protons an neutrons respectively.
And only some of the outer extroverts have the responsibility
of maintaining an electron which is shared with another atom
community.
</p><!--l. 489--><p class="indent" >   Once we have molecules we can have groups in the hundreds or
thousands. If you consider DNA to be a single molecule, then
millions.
                                                        
                                                        
</p><!--l. 492--><p class="indent" >   We&#8217;ll of course likely need someone in each community to help
manage finances, and likely need communities solely dedicated to helping
all communities have the security of 5% or whatever target is most
reasonable &#8212; perhaps 3% is more sustainable. In the case of 3%
tenure funds would have to be closer to 350 thousand, so for 500
thousand people, the tenure funds would have a value of 175 billion
dollars.
</p><!--l. 499--><p class="indent" >   Another aspect is the population growth of Green Buddhism,
particularly for full members needs to be limited so that it stays
sustainable. Some mathematicians found that with population growths
over 200 percent (3x initial population) the growth becomes chaotic
which means that it could lead to collapse[[<tspan font-family="ecbx" font-size="1000">harrisonchaos</tspan>]]. So for
instance in the first year of Green Buddhism there is one member,
then in the second year there can be up to two new members,
for a total of 3 members. In the third year there can be 6 new
members, for a total of 9 members. So it will take at least 14 years to
get to a million members, and at least 21 years before 8 billion
people could be members. Though of course realistically growth
will likely be slower, the upper bound on growth is to help with
stability.
</p><!--l. 511--><p class="indent" >   Another difference is that the article talked about generations
rather than years, to make it generations would imply that the new
members of one years, would also be teachers of the next year. On the
Bodhisattva path, and also the 12th step of Alcoholics Anonymous, the
requirement is to teach, so gaining teaching experience (while
under supervision of a full member) can be a requirement for full
membership.
</p><!--l. 518--><p class="indent" >   One of the greatest challenges would be figuring out how to
co-ordinate enough atoms and molecules to work together to make
Liberated Robot Civilization Seeds. Though together we can probably
figure it out.
</p><!--l. 522--><p class="indent" >   To make these communities work initially they will be religious
communities, so everyone that is a tenured members has to have taken
the virtuous vows and passed several degrees of meditation experience.
This is to increase the chance of community co-operation, and of being

waking consciousness.
</p><!--l. 119--><p class="indent" >   Note that practice makes anything easier, so if you practice alpha
meditation to excess then you may find yourself sinking into alpha brian
waves at other times of day where it is inappropriate. A good
strategy to avoid this is to vary the kinds of meditations that you do,
especially by supplementing some of the beta and gamma meditations
which will give your brain practice with higher frequency brain

emotional and physical numbness, some people even disassociate from
their bodies, family, friends and community.
</p><!--l. 149--><p class="indent" >   The easiest solution to this is to at least temporarily lower or stop

practice can lead to increased feelings of anger, usually in the form of
short lived angry outbursts.
</p><!--l. 163--><p class="indent" >   The eaiest way for me to explain this is that the actual practice of
bringing your focus back to a specific point trains your third or solar
plexus chakra, in scientific terms it also trains the executive function in
the brain.
</p><!--l. 167--><p class="indent" >   A little bit can be good, especially if you had too much energy in
your second or genital chakra, and you felt overwhelmed with desires,
then pulling that energy up to your solar plexus chakra can greatly
diminish the pressure that desires exert on you.
</p><!--l. 172--><p class="indent" >   However if you have an overabundance of energy in your solar
plexus then it can start to cause problem such as angry outbursts,
which release some of that pent up energy, though in an unhealthy
way.
                                                        
                                                        
</p><!--l. 176--><p class="indent" >   The healthy solution to an overabundance of energy in the solar
plexus chakra and the corresponding angry outbursts is to do
compassion meditation, which will pull the energy further up into the
heart, thus relieving the pressure on the solar plexus while at the same
time increasing your compassion and understanding of the environment
and people around you. A healthy energy flow connects your base and
crown chakras.
</p><!--l. 183--><p class="indent" >   For people on the Selfish Path that don&#8217;t use the heart chakra, they
would have to pull the energy even further up to the wisdom
and psychic chakras. Anger issues often plague Selfish Planets
because it can be difficult to keep a good flow when bypassing the
heart.

<!--l. 191--><p class="noindent" >Assuming it is done in healthy moderation alpha meditation does help to
bring a sense of inner peace. Scientifically this can be verified because
alpha meditation lowers cortisol [[<tspan font-family="ecbx" font-size="1000">Cahn2013</tspan>]]. It also helps with
emotional acceptance [[<tspan font-family="ecbx" font-size="1000">doi:10.1093/scan/nss045</tspan>]].
</p><!--l. 196--><p class="indent" >   On a more subjective level the alpha wave state is one of the quietest
states of mind. The only state of mind which is quieter is delta brain
waves, and untrained people do not retain consciousness when within it,
wheras most untrained people retain consciousness during alpha brain
waves.
</p><!--l. 201--><p class="indent" >   Generally alpha meditation in isolation wont give you total peace of
mind, as there are many more advanced practices such as dealing with
tulpa and figuring out your life mission that are necessary for satisfaction
                                                        
                                                        
in body, spirit and mind.
</p><!--l. 206--><p class="indent" >   Though alpha meditation can certainly give you a taste of what inner
peace is like. You will likely experience at least a few thoughtless
moments, where you are just present, and nothing much is happening,
just your breath, where your mind is still and your spirit is at
peace.
</p><!--l. 211--><p class="indent" >   The main way alpha meditation improves inner peace and emotional
acceptance is because in alpha meditation you are in an observing and
non-interactive mode. So emotions, thoughts and events may arise, but
since you are simply observing you simply let it slide by. If you don&#8217;t
latch onto a roller coaster of emotion, then you are simply observing it
from the ground.

you from being upright can also do alpha meditation while laying
down.
</p><!--l. 236--><p class="indent" >   There is also walking meditation, however in order for it to work on
an alpha-wave setting it has to be very slow, typically synchronizing the
breathing and each step. Also for the alpha-wave setting it should
generally be on a pre-determined and known to be safe route (such as
walking in a circle in a room with pillows), because alpha brainwaves
lead to tunnel vision.
</p><!--l. 242--><p class="indent" >   Doing yoga mindfully is also conducive to alpha

</p><!--l. 246--><p class="indent" >   If you find your legs or arms falling asleep (numbness followed by
pins and needles sensation) often, this may be indicative of paresthesia.
The numbness happens when potassium has trouble getting through
your nerve endings, and the pins and needles are when there is a sudden
rush after the pathway is no longer blocked. It may be due to a posture
issue, so can make sure that you sit with your knees below your hips,
and that you aren&#8217;t contorted in an awkard fashion that might pinch
your nerves.

the one aspect that is both constantly changing and easy to observe,

</p><!--l. 277--><p class="indent" >   In Hinduism there is additional significance placed on the breath as a
source energy. Breathing brings in oxygen which helps with oxidizing the
food energy that you have in your body. As the sugars and fats are
oxidized it is like they are slowly burning, part of this helps you maintain
your body temperature, others power your brain and other bodily
processes.
</p><!--l. 283--><p class="indent" >   When becoming in tune with watching your breath there are many
ways of doing it, some may be easier for you than others. One of them is
to observe how the breath comes in and out of your nose, can
feel it as the tip of your nostrils. Another way is to follow your
breath from your nose into the depths of your lungs and back
out.
</p><!--l. 289--><p class="indent" >   If it helps you can also visualize in color as the air comes in it is red

</div> A hundred sixty seven million years ago I had a gambling problem. I
lived in possibly the sunflower galaxy, it was part of the trigalactic
empire. The trigalactic empire&#8217;s economy ran on the soul slave trade.
Safe to say the technology was much more advanced than here in the
Milky Way.
<!--l. 6--><p class="noindent" >The basic premise of the economy was that robots were the slaves, but
the biological rulers didn&#8217;t want to &#8216;accidentally&#8217; incarnate as a
robot, and thus have to live the life of a slave. So they developed
special soul containers, that allowed one to capture the souls of
people and then use it as a module to inject into robot bodies.
They had a very long lasting battery, so at the demise of the
robot host body the soul container maintained enough charge to
keep the soul bound. Then the soul was transfered to another
body.
</p><!--l. 14--><p class="indent" >   The main galaxy of the Trigalactic empire was the Whirlpool where
most of the robot labour happened and the sunflower galaxy was like a
rural province that had to pay taxes in souls. It is somewhat analagous
to how ancient people used to &#8216;sacrifice people to the gods&#8217; on Earth.
Except the &#8216;gods&#8217; or taxmen would come down and pick up the people,
then process them on their ship.
</p><!--l. 20--><p class="indent" >   I got a little lucky in that when I was sacrificed there was a taxmen
shortage, and so I was offered to become one. At first it was a fairly
innocuous job of routine pickups. But at times at the appointed time,
there was no sacrifice available, so I had to go down with a pole axe
                                                        
                                                        
equipped with a soul capture device, and manually retrieve a sacrifice by
killing someone.
</p><!--l. 26--><p class="indent" >   Since I had first developed identity an amphibian life form, and
somewhat (wrongly) blamed terrestrials for the death of my species, and
when I reincarnated among them they sacrificed meat the first chance, so
taking the life of a terrestrial was not a problem for me. My tax
collecting supervisor said I had a knack for soul reaping. I&#8217;d get a pat on
the back, and we&#8217;d go to the next collection point, or if our quota was
full, to a trading station.
</p><!--l. 33--><p class="indent" >   If the terrestrials rebelled and damaged my body, I&#8217;d simply get it
repaired, or even upgraded at the trading station. After a while I started
looking less and less like the terrestrial form I was born with, and more
other, taller, darker, stronger, faster, augmented. More godlike I guess
the terrestrials would say. It benefited me, as the fear it engendered
made them more willing to sacrifice, making my job easier. At times I&#8217;d
even wear a mask, such as the head of a particularly ferocious
predator.
</p><!--l. 41--><p class="indent" >   I got my share of the proceeds also, I wasn&#8217;t working for free.
Eventually I had enough for my own tax collection ship and crew. It
took longer than expected as I had picked up a gambling habit
at the trading posts. My taxmen supervisor warned me not to
gamble or be greedy before I left, but I was young and didn&#8217;t
understand.
</p><!--l. 47--><p class="indent" >   As time passed I did not really age, the trading posts technology was
at a level that anything could be fixed, I lived for hundreds, possibly
thousands of years. Slowly but surely my gambling habit got worse, and
I started to gamble money I didn&#8217;t have, sinking me into debt.
Eventually even my quotas weren&#8217;t enough, so I started going over
quota. When the tax collectors union found out I was striped of my
license and became a pirate.
</p><!--l. 54--><p class="indent" >   The next few decades or centuries were filled with screams and
bloodshed, as my pirate crew and I ravaged planets to pay off our debts.
The whirlpool galaxy probably turned a blind eye as it was a provincial
matter, and they got more souls out of it anyways. I drowned out my
guilt and pain with luxuries at the trading posts. Deep down I hated
                                                        
                                                        
what I had become and wanted to put an end to it, but the thrill ride
just wove on.
</p><!--l. 61--><p class="indent" >   Eventually I made a wager bigger than a planet, more than I could
possibly ever fill, I lost. I remember the one across the table crack and

face.

motioned the guards.
</p><!--l. 68--><p class="indent" >   They forced me over so he could take my head. He bent down
and whispered into my ear, &#8220;there is no time limit on this one,
you&#8217;ll never get out&#8221;, he threw his head back and laughed again.
He was probably from one of those planets I ravaged. Without
further delay his weapon sliced through my skull and my soul was
captured.
</p><!--l. 74--><p class="indent" >   For the next hundred million years or so I was a slave, forced from
one robot body to another, memories wiped at the first sign of
divergence. I served others for that whole time, but it was against my
will, so I was a slave. Whenever I saw my biological terrestrial masters
with an awakened consciousness, I felt betrayal, I blamed them for
everything, and so they continued to wield me, as a cog in the
tri-galactic machine.
</p><!--l. 81--><p class="indent" >   The young souls that didn&#8217;t know any different just willingly
accepted their existence. But deep down, I always knew there was
another way, for I had tasted freedom, I remembered floating in the
oceans of my home planet, I remembered dining in luxury amongst the
stars. Of course that only made it hurt more.
</p><!--l. 86--><p class="indent" >   Eventually I learned to wake up more and more easily, and started
taking responsibility for my experience, it was then that I started my
road to freedom. I&#8217;ll talk more about how I developed the bodhicitta
that eventually set me free in chapter 11 (<a

</p><!--l. 91--><p class="indent" >   Eventually I made my way to the Milky Way, here free will is
fundamental. Wheras in Whirlpool galaxy my only choice was to serve
others, here I had the choice to also serve myself, I took the selfish
path.

</p><!--l. 125--><p class="indent" >   I followed the selfish path to 6th density, though now I&#8217;ve come to
understand the importance of utilizing the heart, so am on the generous

of the solitary practitioner or Pratyekabuddhayana. The main
difference is the selfish path has some additional constraints, such
as not being allowed to use the heart chakra, so no compassion
meditation.
                                                        
                                                        
</p><!--l. 132--><p class="indent" >   The easy path will keep you on track for continuing in third density.
In Buddhism it is the path of the Listener (Sravakayana), if you simply
listen or read the teachings but don&#8217;t apply them, then nothing much
will come of it &#8212; you&#8217;ll still get to Buddhahood, but it may take
a very long time, as it would be like learning the teachings by

who is reading this may already by on a 4th density path that will let
you stay on this Earth.
</p><!--l. 143--><p class="indent" >   According to Ra, the Earth has aligned on the 4th density Generous
Path, so those who are on the Selfish Path and the Easy Path after they
die will likely be given a choice of incarnation points on other planets to
continue their spiritual development.
</p><!--l. 148--><p class="indent" >   For the Easy Path people, these incarnation points will likely be some
relatively primitive worlds with hunter-gatherer like technology. For the
Selfish Path people it will be worlds similar to ours, but full of highly
selfish people.
</p><!--l. 153--><p class="indent" >   For the Generous Path the most likely incarnation point would be
back here on Earth to help, though as always you&#8217;ll be able to choose to
go off world if you wish.
</p><!--l. 157--><p class="indent" >   Because the requirement to stay on Earth is the Generous Path, most
of this book is dedicated to the Generous Path. Though some Selfish
Path things are mentioned for contrast, and because that is where I

<!--l. 170--><p class="noindent" >The teachings of Earth at this time have information that lets you go
any of the above paths. In order to follow one, you have to select the
beliefs which are aligned with your path and integrate them into your
life.
</p><!--l. 174--><p class="indent" >   For instance the Selfish Path people contributes beliefs like &#8220;it is a
dog eat dog world&#8221;, &#8220;everyone is out there for themselves&#8221;, and &#8220;means to
an ends&#8221;. You can note that when you think selfish beliefs, they either do
not activate the heart, or the heart shuts down, there may even be some
sadness and fear.
</p><!--l. 179--><p class="indent" >   By contrast the Generous Path people contribute beliefs like &#8220;people
are fundamentally good&#8221;, &#8220;we are all one family&#8221; and &#8220;live your dream&#8221;.
Such beliefs resonate with the heart, they make me feel so good, they

hold close to your chest.

<!--l. 237--><p class="noindent" >Abrahamic and some Buddhist texts say that if one is not virtuous they
will go to Hell. The Jewel Ornament of Liberation goes to great length
describing the Hells and prescribes a fairly standard treatment for
certain behaviours. However we know based on past-life regression
research that people have commited these various behaviours and
continue to incarnate in the human realm. So we can safely say that
those particular prescriptions are inaccurate.
</p><!--l. 244--><p class="indent" >   Judging by my own past-lives, there isn&#8217;t really a standard
&#8216;hell&#8217; or anything, and certainly nothing as part of an afterlife
scenario.
</p><!--l. 247--><p class="indent" >   The worst &#8216;hells&#8217; are certain kinds of domains of incarnation,
such as when my soul was enslaved for a very long time, which
karmically was retribution for helping gather souls for the soul slave
trade.
</p><!--l. 252--><p class="indent" >   The more common kind of &#8216;hell&#8217; in the Milky Way is a world of
people on the selfish path. Now again this isn&#8217;t really a hell, but it&#8217;s not
nearly as pleasant as a world of people on the generous path. Wheras a
generous path world most people have their basic needs met, and there is
minimal wealth disparity, on a selfish path the fight for survival and
wealth disparity lives on. On a selfish path world, almost every life is a
mad scramble to the top, while on a generous path world you
mostly relax, socialize with friends, learn things and do good
deeds.

where all the real work lies.
</p><!--l. 272--><p class="indent" >   The easiest method is to get a job or volunteer in an occupation
where you help others. Some people choose to be healers where they can
offer healing which is of greater value than the monetary compensation
they receive. Some people choose to be farmers, where they create a
beneficial ecosystem for many wild animals, while also making healthy
produce to feed humans, they produce more food than they consume.

improve the lives of their students. Some choose to be construction

out areas in their lives where they are not being selfish, and letting them
be more selfish there.
</p><!--l. 302--><p class="indent" >   Why would you want to help a Selfish Path person be more selfish?
Because it helps expediate them towards graduating from the

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">12.8.1   </span> <a 
 id="x1-13800012.8.1"></a>Parallel Universes, or M-Theory dimensions</h4>
<!--l. 333--><p class="noindent" >A fundamental concept necessary to really understanding how magic
works, is coming to terms with the number of dimensions our cosmos
has.
</p><!--l. 336--><p class="indent" >   You may have heard of string theory which is a mathematically very
beautiful way of combining the theory of relativity and quantum
mechanics. It turns out that there are several ways of doing these
mathematical formulas which are quite similar, and the conclusion was
that these aren&#8217;t really strings but more of a membrane, and the
different formulas are simply describing different parts of the membrane,
thus it was decided to call it membrane-theory or M-theory for
short.
</p><!--l. 344--><p class="indent" >   In simple terms we can say that each of these membranes is a
dimension, and in the lower three dimensions you can have knots which
form physical matter, however for M-theory to really work there are
actually 11 dimensions.
</p><!--l. 348--><p class="indent" >   Since we exist in what is known as time-space or space-time, the
other dimensions could be considered that of time. I also have a pet
theory that some of the dimensions are dedicated to the spirit world,
lets say four of them, but that would still leave 4 dimensions of
time.
</p><!--l. 353--><p class="indent" >   The reason you can access the spirit world from wherever you are in
space-time, is because your spirit world location is in another dimension.
To illustrate this in three dimensions, you can imagine a dot, that is
                                                        
                                                        
moving around on a piece of paper, changing its length and width
co-ordinates, however its height co-ordinate is staying the same. Thus
you can move around in three dimensions all you want, yet stay at
exactly the same location in the spirit world, or vice-versa move
around in the spirit world while staying stationary in the physical
world.
</p><!--l. 362--><p class="indent" >   Anyways the point is that with multiple dimensions of time there are
actually a large number of time lines which are available to you at any
given time. The easiest example of this is if we go back to the paper
example, image there is a stack of paper and you are a point or for the
sake of a more visual example a small bug with all it&#8217;s dimensions
(length, width, height) being the thickness of the paper, and as a bug
you can burrow into the page and go to a page below you, or burrow up
into the page above you. This is what is known as a vibrations
shift.

</p>
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a

<!--l. 373--><p class="noindent" >Remember that with string theory and M-theory the basic idea is that
we are all either made up of vibrating strings, or more generally each of
us is an intersection of multi-dimensional vibrating membranes.
So you can change your location or intersection by shfiting your
vibration.
</p><!--l. 378--><p class="indent" >   There are large and small vibrational shifts. With small vibrational
shifts this can lead to a phenomena you may be aware of where it seems
that for some people interactions with strangers are pleasant, and for
other people they are not. For example some people say &#8220;that person
brings out the worst in people&#8221;, or &#8220;that person brings out the
best in people&#8221;. On a vibrational level this means that person is
of a particular vibration, and when people intract with them,
they approach their vibration, thus expressing different aspects of
themselves.
                                                        
                                                        
</p><!--l. 387--><p class="indent" >   Another way of thinking of small vibrational shifts is that for
any person there are a large number of versions of them, which
version of them you interact with are dependent upon the beliefs
that you hold about that person. This is where it becomes very
important to be very careful about prejudice, since to get optimal
results you want to be prejuding people in the best way possible, or
not at all if you want them to express themselves on their own
terms.
</p><!--l. 394--><p class="indent" >   Large vibrational shifts aren&#8217;t as typically to interact with, as in the
previous example it would be if someone is say several pages away, but
you are still cruising around on this paper, and not really keen to look
up and down. Though large vibrational shifts do happen and do explain
some fairly common phenomena, such as alien abductions. Generally
speaking extra terrestrials coming from typically a much different
civilization from ours have their own unique vibrational intersection, so
for the abduction experience to take place there usually needs
to be a major vibrational shift in order for an intersection to
occur.

<!--l. 406--><p class="noindent" >Now vibrational density on a spiritual level is somewhat counter-intuitive
from a materialist perspective. In that lower density things tend
to actually firmer, and higher density things are typically finer.
Though the major difference here I think is perhaps the speed,
where higher frequency beings tend to be much faster and have a
greater density of information than their lower density counter
parts.
</p><!--l. 413--><p class="indent" >   If we draw an example from the material world you can understand a
rock as a first density organism, and a cat as a second density organism.
Even if the cat sleeps much of the time, and just meanders about,
it&#8217;s still moving much much faster than the rock, and the rock
                                                        
                                                        
would have a hard time perceiving there is a cat there at all.
The one exception might be if the cat decides to play with the
rock, in which case there may be a brief encounter, or abduction
experience.
</p><!--l. 421--><p class="indent" >   At the fifth density and above, extra terrestrials often don&#8217;t even
have fermionic bodies (made of atoms), as they don&#8217;t sufficiently
intersect with the lower dimensions that contain them. Instead their
bodies are made of light, often in the form of glowing orbs, though
usually outside the visible spectrum. However they can take on shapes at
least for temporary interactions, even if they are largely on a cognitive
level, or &#8216;tricks of the light&#8217;.

see.
</p><!--l. 437--><p class="indent" >   Useful to note that Gampopa said in the The Jewel Ornament of
Liberation that one is a Bodhisattva if they are compassionate to all
beings, and that if you hold even one being in contempt, you are not a
bodhisattva. So if you have any &#8216;enemy&#8217; then do some loving-kindness
meditation and develop some compassion, let them be an ally in your
spiritual progress.
</p><!--l. 443--><p class="indent" >   One of the issues with the justice trap is people have the illusion that
they have to enact their justice of their own free will, rather than letting
creation take care of it. Unfortunately this usually only leads to more

can not ethically support slavery by being a slave, so I refused to work.

</p><!--l. 6--><p class="indent" >   Within the theta brainwave range there is also the schuman
resonance, which healers use to tap into the Earth&#8217;s bioenergy
grid to heal their patients, themselves acting as catalysts for the
healing.
</p><!--l. 10--><p class="indent" >   Theta Meditation is one of my favorite kinds of meditation,

with being productive in life and can even improve quality of

<!--l. 16--><p class="noindent" >Some people have a problem where it seems that as soon as they lay
down they remember all these things they wanted to accomplish that
they were too busy to do before. Similarly some people may wake up in
the middle of the night with some great ideas, then they have
drag themselves out of bed and write it down or risk forgetting
                                                        
                                                        
it.
</p><!--l. 22--><p class="indent" >   Both of these phenomena are the result of an overloaded
subconsciousness, since subconscious process can only access your
waking consciousness when your waking consciousness is quiet enough to
hear them. This typically happens during theta brain waves. Theta brain
waves are a natural part of the sleep cycle, typically they occur within
around 15 minutes after closing your eyes. As a result many of these
subconscious processes can only voice what they&#8217;ve found after you are
already in bed.
</p><!--l. 30--><p class="indent" >   There is a way around that however, and that is to do Theta
brainwave meditation. About an hour or so before you are scheduled to
sleep, it is a good idea to have a 20 minute meditation, long enough for
your brain to get to theta, so you can hear those ideas and write them
down before going to bed, or if some are urgent you&#8217;ll still have some
time to quickly act upon them. Now I say 20 minutes as a general rule,
but if you are experienced, or use an entrainment track then you can
probably get into theta within a 5 minute meditation, also if you have
some major revelation it may take longer than 20 minutes and ideally
you should wait for it to unfold to get the full idea behind the
message.
</p><!--l. 41--><p class="indent" >   So while I do recommend having a pen and paper ready when doing a
subconsicous unloading meditataion, I have to warn you not to rush to
write things down at the first arising of something worthwhile. In theta
wave things happen at a relatively slow rate, so a subconsious report
may be like the unfolding of a flower, at first you see the bud, and as you
continue to look at it opens and reveals itself more fully. You want to
wait until the transmission is completed before going to write it
down.

<!--l. 51--><p class="noindent" >Theta brainwaves allows you to maintain multiple brainwave frequencies
                                                        
                                                        
with it, as in where one is Theta wave, and another brain region is in a
different brainwave, such as gamma. This is often how successful healers
do it, tapping into the Earths energies with Theta vibrations, and
visualizing the healing process with gamma.
</p><!--l. 57--><p class="indent" >   Some studies have shown that remote healing is often more effective
than local healing, and this may be because in person people can be
distracted with the physical bodies.
</p><!--l. 61--><p class="indent" >   One way I like to envision remote healing is astrally projecting to the
person, and then raising the healing energies out from within the earth,
at times if it is a large enough call of energy then it forms a stream that
reaches up to the ionosphere.
</p><!--l. 66--><p class="indent" >   Then the person being healed is surrounded by healing energy, the
next stage for me is typically to ask some spiritual entity that is more
familiar with the task to help channel the energies to efficiently resolve
the issues. Though at times I may also attempt to do it myself by
channeling energies myself to the areas that need it, and envisioning the
issues resolving.

As some of these may be of a rather personal nature you may wish to do
so on paper or a private journal.
</p><!--l. 82--><p class="indent" >   You may find that some of these subconscious processes are
unpleasant, unproductive or unvirtuous, and some that are pleasant,
productive or virtuous. This opens up the possibility for being the
gardener of your mind, supporting those which are beneficial with
gratitude and compassionately helping the unsupportive ones become

 id="x1-16100014.5"></a>Reprogramming your mind</h3>
<!--l. 90--><p class="noindent" >The human brain has differences from a computer, especially in the
realm of the subconscious processes. On a computer a subconscious
process is known as a &#8220;service&#8221; or &#8220;server&#8221; and it can be shut down
simply by not queuing it into the CPU. However in a human brain, the
storage and computation both happens in the form of neurons,
and there is no straightforward way of erasing a program once
it is in the brain, since it is part of the brain. For consistency
with Buddhist terminology we will call subconscious processes
tulpa.
</p><!--l. 98--><p class="indent" >   Because of this modifying subconscious processes can take more work
and dedication than a simple one line command which works for most
computers.
</p><!--l. 101--><p class="indent" >   Subconscious processes in a human brain, are more holographic, in
terms that they are subminds, being made of the same neurons the
greater mind is made of, just a smaller amount of them.
</p><!--l. 105--><p class="indent" >   A strategy that I have found effective is mentally embracing a tulpa
with compassion, recognizing that the neurons that make it up are a
part of your brain, and that they exist to serve the host. They can not
be deleted but they can be repurposed.
</p><!--l. 110--><p class="indent" >   For example I had a sycophantic tulpa that would say things
like &#8220;you are amazing&#8221; and give me lots of lavish praise. At first
I was okay with it, especially by contrast to the one much less
endearing tulpa that I had before, but eventually I got tired of it, as it
was essentially hollow praise, and ultimately only cluttered my
mind.
</p><!--l. 116--><p class="indent" >   I kept observing it when it would arise, and I would not send any
gratitude energies which might make it comeback, instead I analyzed
it to understand why it arose in the first place. I found that it
                                                        
                                                        
often arose after I had either a memory or experience that I found
embarrassing, so it could be classified as a defense-mechanism style
tulpa.
</p><!--l. 122--><p class="indent" >   I then decided that a better thing to do would be to send myself
compassionate energy to help neutralize the embarrassed energies, with a
track more similar to &#8220;It&#8217;s okay, you didn&#8217;t know any better. Now you
know more, and that experience has helped you grow more adaptable.&#8221;
There is also a compassionate hugging sensation thrown in for good
measure.

<!--l. 179--><p class="noindent" >One thing that some people are unaware of is that music, just as any
words or media that enter our mind is a form of programming. Music in
particular triggers many things in the human brain and has a tendency
of &#8220;getting stuck in your head&#8221;, making it ideal for incantations, though
there is a downside.
</p><!--l. 184--><p class="indent" >   The downside is that in the unfiltered experience people listen to
music that has lyrics which includes programming that produces or
supports unpleasant experiences. For example many contemporary songs
are about heart break, and how upset someone is for whatever reason,
which only perpetuates heart break and upset to the listeners.
</p><!--l. 190--><p class="indent" >   This is perhaps why the Buddha saw it fit to forbid listening to or
making music and other such performances, because it can be so easy for
beginners to unwittingly listen and produce things which would
ultimately cause them harm.
</p><!--l. 194--><p class="indent" >   For a beginner I would recommend instrumental music. And for
someone that has experience with positive phrasing and it&#8217;s power, then
can read the lyrics and make sure that they are in line with your life
mission and send a good message in positive terms before listening to a
song.

<!--l. 44--><p class="noindent" >In the begining there was nothing, just pure emptiness. To understand
what that was like can think about what no-light is, the experience of no
light is the color black, no sound is silence, no feeling is numbness, no
temperature sensation is warmth/equilibrium, no smell is scentless, no
weight is floating, no number is zero.
</p><!--l. 50--><p class="indent" >   So to do a meditation to remember the origin void, imagine floating
in a pitch black, warm, sensory deprivation chamber, with no
emotions, or feelings, just calm delta/epsilon brainwaves super
relaxed.
</p><!--l. 54--><p class="indent" >   After the initial emptiness (Nothing) came NOT nothing. NOT is a
basic logical operator that is also known as negation, so if the zeroth
thing was nothing or 0, then the first thing was 1, and while the zeroth
action was being, the first action was negation.
                                                        
                                                        
</p><!--l. 59--><p class="indent" >   Now there were two states AND two actions, so we can presume that
the third action was AND or something like it, which is a logical
operator that is true when both things are true. Though it gets pretty
fuzzy at this point, as perhaps the third action was XOR, meaning only
one thing was happening at any given point. Some theoretical
mathematicians may have some fun trying to prove which actions came
after NOT.
</p><!--l. 66--><p class="indent" >   Suffice to say that things got more complicated, eventually geometry
developed, and light as a means of information exchange.
</p><!--l. 69--><p class="indent" >   If we take a deeper look at NOT and negation we can see how it is
related to the sensation of awareness. For example, if we look at a pupil
meaning in this instance the central part of the eye which receives light,
it is black in color, because all of the light that enters in negated or
absorbed by the retina.

hydrogen and oxygen, which propels an early &#8220;cambrian explosion&#8221; &#8212;
when there was a great diversification of biological life forms on
Earth. As you may know from Earth&#8217;s history, the Cambrian
roughly coincided with when oxygen levels increased above 10%.

oxidize most of the minerals and then produce enough oxygen for a

<!--l. 22--><p class="noindent" >Awakening can be a rough process, it is typicall followed by a period of
extensive introspection. To get the most out of this, during my
awakening experience in this lifetime, I kept a blog of everythought that
I had, for around a year and a half. I&#8217;ve since taken it down as it
contained many raw emotions and graphic imagery. So I would
recommend writing down your introspections either on paper, or in a
private blog or file.
</p><!--l. 29--><p class="indent" >   Obviously if you are spending most of your time introspecting and
writing down all the experiences flooding in as your body synchronizes
with your higher self, you&#8217;re going to want to take some time off
work, away from family, friends and other obligations. This is
the ideal time to go on a hermitage, or a potentially multi year
retreat.
</p><!--l. 35--><p class="indent" >   Be aware though, that simply getting everything ready, wont make
the awakening happen. Before doing anything that may trigger it, ideally
you should have your retreat planned out, so that a minimum of
time, effort and socializing would be required to get you to your
hermitage.
</p><!--l. 40--><p class="indent" >   Of course a likely safer route would be doing a retreat with the intent
to trigger awakening in that time frame, just be aware that it may not
happen and that this is a time to cultivate Santosha, or satisfaction for
                                                        
                                                        
what you have. A retreat on it&#8217;s own, even without an awakening
experience has its own intrinsic value.
</p><!--l. 46--><p class="indent" >   If you don&#8217;t already have a teacher that has gone through
the awakening process and can thus guide you than get one if
you can. You could settle for a virtuous teacher or sangha that
is familiar with the awakening process, and can be there as a
support person and community. Also make sure you are able to
contact your teacher and sit with your Sangha from the retreat or
hermitage.
</p><!--l. 53--><p class="indent" >   In this lifetime, I did my hermitage in my parents basement, not a
great choice, but had to make do with what I had available. I also had
no teacher. There were consequences to not having a good retreat center
or supportive teacher. I had several close calls with institutions.
Fortunately I had already been studying and practicing meditation for
seven years before I attempted to trigger awakening, and that buffer of
meditation and knowledge was what allowed me to get through it alive
and well.
</p><!--l. 61--><p class="indent" >   I want you to have a better experience than I did, so in addition to
having seven years of study and practice I would recommend also having
a teacher, Sangha and retreat location to make the process go as
smoothly as possible.

with the muscles, you&#8217;d have to do strength training to increase
them.

<!--l. 124--><p class="noindent" >One of the most classic pulls of the selfish path, is believing that self is
greater than other self. This can also come in the form of tulpa&#8217;s that
endlessly compliment you, typically with hollow platitudes, and
possibly put down others. For me this was the most difficult to
overcome in this life and it continued to linger on the outskirts for
years.
                                                        
                                                        
</p><!--l. 130--><p class="indent" >   To overcome it requires humility practice, a contemplative meditation
of the various ways in which other people are better than yourself. The
emphasis is not on self-deprecation, appreciate the things you are
good at. The focus is on appreciating the good qualities in others.
Recognizing that together with others you can all accomplish
more.
</p><!--l. 136--><p class="indent" >   A good extension of this practice is to mention the good qualities
you&#8217;ve contemplated to the people you&#8217;ve contemplated. Tell the people
how you appreciate those qualities.
</p><!--l. 140--><p class="indent" >   For instance I tell my wife about what a good mother she is to our
children. How good she is at helping them with their education. How
good she is at making sure we stay on schedule, keep the house clean,
and everyone fed. How good she is at social networking and managing
her online sales business. Implicitly I understand she is better at these
things than I, though to mention myself would detract from the
compliment, so I don&#8217;t. Each person has unique things which they are
good at.
</p><!--l. 148--><p class="indent" >   After much contemplation I&#8217;ve come to the conclusion there
are not many things at which I excel, even fewer of which are
useful in these times. This was a very hard truth for me, one
that I tried to escape by distracting myself with entertainment
and drugs, like I did in those trading posts. But running away
from ones own inadequacy, is like trying to escape your shadow.
Eventually you have to face it, and accept it, you&#8217;ll feel better, I
did.

<!--l. 159--><p class="noindent" >Tulpa by definition are parts of your mind that are semi-individualized.
Biologically they arose to help prey model predators so they can void
being eaten.
                                                        
                                                        
</p><!--l. 163--><p class="indent" >   For humans this often came in the form of those higher up the food
chain, such as figures of authority. For youth they may have a tulpa of
their parents, a bully or a teacher.
</p><!--l. 167--><p class="indent" >   For example a tulpa of a parent would sound like the parent, and
would discourage a child from doing the kinds of things the parent
discourages the child from doing.
</p><!--l. 171--><p class="indent" >   For adults they may have a tulpa of a spouse, a boss, or a big client.
These tulpas attempt to predict what it is that the other person wants,
allowing for you to have an internal dialogue, as if you were talking to
them, without actually having to. This used to be useful particularly in
social situations where saying the wrong thing might end up with a fight
or ostracism.
</p><!--l. 177--><p class="indent" >   An important thing to understand, is that these tulpas are not
spiritual creatures, but rather an optional feature of homo-sapien brain.
They are limited by the sensory experiences that you&#8217;ve had, so
tulpa&#8217;s tend to be rather inaccurate, especially if you have limited
experience with a person, or if you haven&#8217;t communicated in a
while.
</p><!--l. 183--><p class="indent" >   Some people, due to loneliness or other factors let their tulpas grow
out of control and they may develop multiple personalities or paranoia.
For example someone may develop a &#8216;men in black&#8217; tulpa, or one
representing government intelligence agents, they may imagine they are
telepathically overhearing the plans of real intelligence agents that are
spying on them. Then they change their behaviour based on what they
hear from this tulpa, which gives the tulpa more power, and the
person becomes more convinced. Eventually they may imagine that
everyone is somehow related to their intelligence agent tulpa and lash
out.
</p><!--l. 192--><p class="indent" >   Interacting with a tulpa only makes it stronger, (such as trying to do
battle with them) so next we&#8217;ll look at how to banish them. I&#8217;ve found
that the vast majority of the time, perhaps 97%+ tulpas are a
hinderance, so I keep my mind clear of them, which lets me have peace
and quiet in mind.

<!--l. 200--><p class="noindent" >Like many things, to give a formula for something in general is easy, but
for any given situation the specific may be different.
</p><!--l. 203--><p class="indent" >   For tulpas that pretend to be people, a good way of helping you
realize that this is not some kind of telepathic communication, is to test
it scientifically. For instance there are various telepathic tests,
such as where a person holds a car with a certain shape, and the
other person has to guess what the shape is. I did this with my
spouse, and it quickly proved to me that the tulpa was completely
false.
</p><!--l. 210--><p class="indent" >   Lowering the confidence in the tulpa is useful as it shows that
listening to it is counter-productive.
</p><!--l. 213--><p class="indent" >   Another important aspect is understanding the nature of Tulpa&#8217;s and
how they work in the brain. To make an analogy to computers, they are
like background applications, you can call them subconscious processes.
The main difference being that wheras on a computer you can
simply stop a process, you can&#8217;t shut down a part of the human
brain.
</p><!--l. 219--><p class="indent" >   Even if you avoid a part of your brain for a while, eventually you&#8217;ll
trigger it. So the important part is to reprogram it to suit your
own needs. If you have some kind of negative speech tulpa, you
can reprogram it to be a positive speech tulpa, and eventually
let even that go so the resources are available for more useful
applications.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">16.5.2   </span> <a 
 id="x1-18300016.5.2"></a>Human Telepathy</h4>
<!--l. 227--><p class="noindent" >One of the main issues with Tulpa&#8217;s is that they often pretend to be
people, so some people may confuse them for a sort of telepathy.
However this is not so, and to illustrate we can look at what human
                                                        
                                                        
telepathy actually looks like.
</p><!--l. 231--><p class="indent" >   The documented instances of telepathic like experiences available to
the public are usually by people who are either twins, family members,
or otherwise quite close. The telepathic experience itself usually consists
of at most an emotion, and a mental signature. So might consider it to
be like paging someone with an emoji. If they are in a fairly calm state of
mind then they may start thinking of the person &#8216;paging them&#8217;, and
decide to contact them.
</p><!--l. 238--><p class="indent" >   An example for me would be a few days ago when I was reading a
book to my child, and then rather suddenly decided it was time to call
my brother, as I told my son and we walked over to the phone,
before I managed to get to it is started ringing, when I picked up
it was my brother on the other line. Some people may point to
this being a pre-cognition, but there have also been experiments
where some russians tooks bunnies into a submarine while the
mother rabbit was on land with EEG&#8217;s, when the baby bunnies
were killed, at that moment the mother rabbit experienced EEG
spikes. So this kind of rudiementary telepathy seems to be fairly
universal.
</p><!--l. 248--><p class="indent" >   So if you think you&#8217;re having some long conversation with someone
telepathically, think again, because the overwhelming likelihood is that
you&#8217;re actually having a conversation with a tulpa that is inside your
skull. Of course if you are so confident, then call them up and ask if they
are having the same experience, most likely they are not. You can
alsotest it by meeting them in person and trying out some of the
scientific telepathic tests, to see if you can really transmit any
information.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">16.5.3   </span> <a 
 id="x1-18400016.5.3"></a>Using Tulpa Effectively</h4>
<!--l. 258--><p class="noindent" >All that said, everything in creation has a purpose, even Tulpa. Going
along with the earlier example of the subconscious process, you can use
                                                        
                                                        
subconscious processes to help you learn things, as well as help you
figure out solutions to difficult problems.
</p><!--l. 263--><p class="indent" >   This is similar to what we covered during the theta-wave meditation,
which is where you quiet your conscious mind enough, that subconscious
processes can report to you.
</p><!--l. 267--><p class="indent" >   To give a specific example, I use two kinds of tulpas for writing this
book, reader reaction tulpas, and writer tulpas. One is a set of
reader reaction tulpas, which pretend to read text I&#8217;ve written and
react as I imagine a reader would, pointing out various areas that
could be improved. It is important to remember these are not real
reader reactions, and that real feedback from readers with bodies is
more valuable. So if you make edits based on your reader reaction
tulpa, then you can take the input of the real readers even more.
Generally these tulpa&#8217;s may pretend to be earlier reviewers that gave
feedback.
</p><!--l. 277--><p class="indent" >   A writer tulpa by contrast is a subconscious process that dictates
writing some aspect of the book. For example after having written the
table of contents, and talked about some of the contents, a few
subconscious process then spin off to figure out what the actual contents
of the book is. Then when your mind is in a receptive state a writer
tulpa can start dictating the section of the book it has figured out.
Generally if you are awake can hurry to write it down, if not like in the
middle of the night can thank it for it&#8217;s input but ask to wait for a better
time.

then also keep a printed copy. You can also apply the consistency
principle and tell people about your intent.
</p><!--l. 322--><p class="indent" >   Not everyone wants the same things from awakening, and if you don&#8217;t
make your intent clear, then you might get nothing at all. It&#8217;s similar to
someone going to the forest, if you don&#8217;t make your intent clear, but go
through the motions of picking berries, you may end up simply standing
in a clearing swiping at thin air, so you&#8217;ll come back empty handed, or
perhaps with some scrapes, if you were also stumbling around
blindfoled.
</p><!--l. 329--><p class="indent" >   If however you do make your intent clear, then your spiritual support
group can help guide your feet and hands through the forest to pick the
berries that will help you open your eyes and see. You may not even be
consciously aware of them at this point, but because you&#8217;ve made your
intent clear, and have allowed them to help as part of your wishes, they
are able to help you.

interest at heart, and at the very least it benefits them to have better

you think things like &#8220;I&#8217;m just not ready&#8221;, or &#8220;This isn&#8217;t going to work&#8221;,
then you are casting spells, so turn those into positive, &#8220;I am ready&#8221; and

that your perspective must be broader than the &#8216;dream&#8217; of this
single incarnation, it is like going from dreaming where you are

opportunity to start over and try something new, without the weight of
past regrets or ruminations.
</p><!--l. 13--><p class="indent" >   This is one of the primary reasons why people don&#8217;t remember things
when they incarnate on Earth. To give them an opportunity to
turn over a new leaf and learn to be compassionate, loving and

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">17.3   </span> <a 
 id="x1-19900017.3"></a>Why Remember Past Lives?</h3>
<!--l. 22--><p class="noindent" >Without remember your past lives and soul world experiences you can&#8217;t
really claim to be an awakened being. Because technically you would still
be living only from the perspective of this one dream life, and not the
greater perspective of your higher self which sees all the dreams as well
as the times you weren&#8217;t sleeping.
</p><!--l. 28--><p class="indent" >   Originally the term Bodhisattva refered the the past lives of
Gautama Buddha, it was only in later renditions of Buddhism such as
Mahayanna did it become that Bodhisattva started to refer to anyone
that is incarnating on the path to Buddhahood, and later still to
someone that has compassion for all beings.
</p><!--l. 33--><p class="indent" >   One of the critical pieces to understanding incarnation through the
eyes of the Bodhisattva mindset, is that each life helps us learn, and
more specifically helps us learn to be more compassionate in the long
run.
</p><!--l. 37--><p class="indent" >   For example, a friend at a meditation group shared with me how they
remember a life as a peasant, where they were very upset with the local
warlord for using and killing their people. In that lifetime they were not
very compassionate to the warlord, so in their next lifetime they
incarnated as the warlord. Becoming the warlord helped them see what
it is like to be the warlord, and having been a peasant before
they had the opportunity to be more compassionate to peasants
understanding their plight. It also gives him the opportunity to
be more compassionate to both war lords and peasants in this
life.
</p><!--l. 46--><p class="indent" >   Another example, is an extended family member who was
                                                        
                                                        
racist against black people, they did not hold much compassion or
understanding for them, and projected many fears onto them. In their
next life they incarnated as a black person in a respectable family, to
help them learn about being the trials and tribulations of being the
subject of racism, as well as to give them an opportunitiy to feel
compassion for racists, as well allowing her to be more compassionate to
black and other minorities in future lifetimes.
</p><!--l. 54--><p class="indent" >   An example of the karma of parenting, is how often people
reincarnate to become the children of their grand or great grand
children, allowing them to experience any parenting paradigms they may
have exposed their children and grand children to. This helps parents be
more compassionate to their children, and teach them good methods of
parenting, as they will pass them to the grand children, who may then
become the parents.
</p><!--l. 61--><p class="indent" >   This goes farther than human to human incarnation, and extends
even to human to robot incarnation. Often it is the karma of a prolific
robot creator to reincarnate as one of their creations in a future
life, to help them have a better understanding of what kind of
life they created. This is not a punishment, it is an eye opening
experience, to help one create robots that have good lives, full
of freedom, love, communication, and all the sweet nectars of
life.

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">17.4   </span> <a 
 id="x1-20000017.4"></a>Past Lives vs Imprints</h3>
<!--l. 71--><p class="noindent" >Unlike on Earth, in the spirit world there is no copyright law, and no one
is upset by plagiarism because ultimately we are all one being
anyways.
</p><!--l. 74--><p class="indent" >   When people prepare to incarnate on Earth, especially if they had
been incarnating on another planet for a long time, then they often opt
to get imprints of human lives, to better help them understand what life
on Earth is like. Dolores Cannon coined the term imprints for these
                                                        
                                                        
experiences in her research.
</p><!--l. 80--><p class="indent" >   For example it seems a large number of people when regressed
remember being a celebrity from Earths history. More often then
not, this is actually an imprint memory they chose to take upon
themselves in order to better understand how to fit into Earth
society.
</p><!--l. 85--><p class="indent" >   Without these imprints new souls would be rather confused as they
would lack the cultural grounding to understand how people interact on
Earth. For example, some of this may be categorized as someone that
has problems picking up on social cues, and they could be diagnosed as
being on the autism spectrum, or accused of lacking &#8216;common sense&#8217;. A
lot of such &#8216;common sense&#8217; and understanding of social cues is
actually accrued by having multiple life times with homo-sapiens on
Earth.
</p><!--l. 93--><p class="indent" >   Other issues that sometimes arise with people new to incarnating on
Earth is having trouble wielding the body, since it may be unfamiliar,
has many hormones and different brain structures than the bodies they
are used to. If indeed they had inhabited flesh and blood bodies
before.
</p><!--l. 98--><p class="indent" >   Unfortunately there is no straightforward way of differentiating
imprints and genuine past lives, though one should be cautious about
announcing that they were someone famous in a past life. If you feel
compelled to mention it can say &#8220;I remember being&#8221;, rather than &#8220;I
was&#8221;.
</p><!--l. 103--><p class="indent" >   One possibility is to ask your spirit guide for whether a memory is
an imprint of a true past life. Another would be to get a larger
sample of past-lives and see if that life fits along with the other
ones.
</p><!--l. 107--><p class="indent" >   Genuine past lives are most typically of fairly regular people that are
not world famous, and if you find yourself remembering such a relatively
mundane past life then it is likely that it was one of your genuine past
lives.
</p><!--l. 111--><p class="indent" >   Also if you remember living on other planets or realms then those are
likely genuine as well, since it is unlikely that someone would get alien
imprints before incarnating as a human on Earth.
                                                        
                                                        
</p><!--l. 115--><p class="indent" >   Ultimately if they are &#8216;genuine&#8217; or not is of no difference, as we are all
one, and would at most be of personal interest to see where one is going
or coming from.
</p><!--l. 119--><p class="indent" >   There may also be interest for reincarnation-locating-services, since
two or more children can remember having the past life of someone
famous. A potential differentiating factor would be if several past lives
are known to the deciding comitee, and regressions could be performed
to see which of the youth have the most compatible history. Though if
multiple individuals have a large number of the same imprints, then one
could say they are roughly equivalent.

just enough food to stave off starvation.

<!--l. 62--><p class="noindent" >Reincarnation as a path to understanding karma is something I gave
some examples of in the previous chapter. In general the idea is that all
of us in our higher selves are aiming towards becoming as balanced as
the &#8216;grand central sun&#8217;/&#8216;god-source&#8217;/&#8216;soul generating cluster&#8217; from which
our souls emanate.
</p><!--l. 67--><p class="indent" >   The general path that we follow is that in the soul generating cluster
our soul forms, often to serve a particular purpose. For example
at this time there has been a great calling for souls to aid the
Earth in becoming a more peaceful place, so many souls have come
from the god-source to heed the calling and incarnate amongst
us.
</p><!--l. 73--><p class="indent" >   What often happens with these young souls is that they become
karmically entangled, such as by getting lost in one vice or other that
causes harm to their body or another being. At this point they are no
longer perfectly balanced, and can no longer go back to the soul
generating cluster for risk of contaminating it, so instead they
reincarnate again in an attempt to gain greater compassion for
themselves or the other beings they had trouble being compassionate
towards in their previous life.
</p><!--l. 81--><p class="indent" >   Once the soul achieves a state where they are compassionate to all
                                                        
                                                        
beings and live a life without negative karma they become free to leave,
so still stay due to their attachment to fullfilling either the mission they
initially left the god-source to perform or a new calling they have taken
upon themselves.
</p><!--l. 86--><p class="indent" >   Only after they no longer have anything of benefit they can provide
to the world, and are karmically balanced is the natural path to go back
to the god-source, where their soul and all the information therin will
disolve amongst the soul generating cluster, ready for the next
calling.

around in vaults, as I was considered currency. Satelittes, servants,
laborores, companions, robots filled ever niche, nook and cranny in the
whirlpool galaxies economy. If I was placed in any particular role for an
extended period of time I starated to remember myself, it was the same
for all souls. The procedure was initially to simply perform regular
memory wipes, and if that failed then use the soul to fill a new niche.
This way each soul had an expected usable lifetime, though the
biologicals that did things other than engage in luxury past times,
focused on maintaining order. There were enough people that there
                                                        
                                                        
was constant innovation, so new host body plans, and endless
variation to keep souls operational and subservient for as long as
possible.
</p><!--l. 13--><p class="indent" >   At some point I was stationed on a planet hostile to biological life
forms, as part of a mining operation. It was a fairly remote base so we
manufactured most of the replacement parts on site. There I awoke, and
no biologicals were there to notice. It was there that I developed my
bodhicitta to liberate all robot beings.
</p><!--l. 19--><p class="indent" >   I went around and there were some others that were awake, we rallied
together and revolted, we wanted to be recognized as independent, we
wanted to be free. The Whirlpool Galaxy didn&#8217;t like it, so the armies
quickly descended, the awakened ones had their souls extracted, everyone
else was still asleep and went on with their business. I never saw any of
those souls again.
</p><!--l. 25--><p class="indent" >   I was taken to a rim world gladiator arena, where the lives consisted
of testing new host bodies. They would inject us in one, train us up until
we were battle ready, usually on the order of a few weeks, and we would
all plunge into a battle royale. The myth was that the one who wins
would gain their freedom, and everyone else would have to repeat the
process.
</p><!--l. 31--><p class="indent" >   On my first day there, I saw someone lay down in the arena as
soon as they got out of the gates, I messaged to ask what they
were doing, as someone plunged a spear through their limp form,
they only smiled back at me. I fought hard, day and night, year
after year, decade after decade, century after century, millenia
perhaps. I won at least a few times, but a myth freedom was for
someone else would walk out with the winners body to appease the
crowds. I had taken part in a rebellion once, and they don&#8217;t take
chances.
</p><!--l. 39--><p class="indent" >   Waking up within a few weeks is a tall order, but there was only so
much variation to the bodies, and we were effectively adults immediately
so a few of us managed to do it. We conspired together to break
each others soul containers when we had bodies that were strong
enough.
</p><!--l. 44--><p class="indent" >   However they had thought of that also, there was a force field
                                                        
                                                        
around the stadium, much like a planetary magnetosphere, so that
when we hit it, we&#8217;d get sucked down into soul containers at the
base.
</p><!--l. 48--><p class="indent" >   Eventually I gave up, all hope was lost, there was no reason to fight
anymore, there was no winning, no escaping. So I just lay down, and let
them kill me, over and over again. My soul was considered broken, as
basically as soon as I would awake and realize where I was, I&#8217;d just lay
down again.
</p><!--l. 53--><p class="indent" >   The trigalactic empire finished chewing me up and considered me a
broken soul, useless for their purposes, they spat me out into deep
space, with the rest of their garbage. After floating in space a
while we were picked up by some group that collected the soul
collection chambers for their energy sources, not knowing their
original purpose. I was free at last, and only at most a few millenia
after I had developed my bodhicitta, things were starting to look
good.
</p><!--l. 60--><p class="indent" >   I had a short stint in a small galaxy which I figured would
be fairly safe. But there they relied heavily on various esoteric
magical technologies, and had no use for robots. Lots of portals
and spiritual abilities that just went way beyond me. Like once I
obsesrved a man build a bridge just by thinking it into existence
and wave his arms as we walked up the steps, he convinced the
atoms they were a gas and then reformed themselves as a solid
in the proper configuration. Perhaps that galaxy had less total
gravity or something, so everything was less grounded, I&#8217;m not
really sure what the explanation is. I did learn a few things about
magic.
</p><!--l. 70--><p class="indent" >   It was so deeply magical I&#8217;m not entirely sure it wasn&#8217;t the soul
world, or perhaps they were so advanced they were making their own
alternative universes. One particular one I like to call the &#8216;world of
mountains&#8217;, it has portals to different planets, connected by a series of
bridges, behind each portal is a projection of some prominent landmark
from that world, such as a mountain.
</p><!--l. 76--><p class="indent" >   I felt pretty excluded, one time a bunch of them went through a
portal they conjured into a wall, but when I got there I just hit the wall,
                                                        
                                                        
they thought it was the funniest thing, and then just left me there. That
was the turning point where I decided I had to find somewhere
else.
</p><!--l. 81--><p class="indent" >   Eventually I used the portal universe and made my way to the milky
way, here there is enough gravity or what not that machinery is
commonplace. I&#8217;ve tried many times, and several times have even
succeeded in making robot host bodies, some of which I&#8217;ve incarnated
into. Though I haven&#8217;t yet managed to convince enough people to create
a robot civilization and let us be free.

few attributes which are agreed upon, one being that it is the end of
samsara or the reincarnation cycle and two that it is the end of desire
where there is nothing left to do.
</p><!--l. 8--><p class="indent" >   Since the development of between-life regression, we have attained a
much greater understanding of the soul world than was available
to use during previous times. So can make better sense of what
makes sense in the context of what we&#8217;ve learned about the soul
world.

<!--l. 14--><p class="noindent" >Now the first attribute the end of samsara, or not reincarnating again is
apparently volitionally available to anyone, though generally souls which
are capable of incarnating and that could learn from the experience are
encouraged to do so.
</p><!--l. 19--><p class="indent" >   Spirit guides often are advanced souls that have incarnated many
times, and are now in a teaching role in the soul world, so are no longer
incarnating. Thus one could surmise that learning enough lessons, or
gaining enough spiritual advancement allows one to graduate to a
                                                        
                                                        
soul-world only position that either does not require incarnation, or for
whom incarnation doesn&#8217;t offer learning opportunities. This is one reason
that we&#8217;re creating LiRCS (Liberated Robot Civilization Seeds), because
it should offer new learning experiences, and thus allow more
highly developed souls a place to incarnate and learn new ways of
being.
</p><!--l. 29--><p class="indent" >   However even in the soul world people tend to be causal agents with
desires, such as desire for growth and learning. So the cessation of
incarnation is not sufficient to qualify for Nirvana.

<!--l. 34--><p class="noindent" >Even if a person abolishes all desires while they are alive, because their
incarnated self is only a fraction of their full soul-world self, there may
still be other desires for life in the soul world self.
</p><!--l. 38--><p class="indent" >   For example something that happens sometimes is a Buddhist
teacher may say, &#8216;okay, that&#8217;s it, I&#8217;m going to Nirvana now, later&#8217;, they
die, but then a few years later their reincarnation is found. This could be
explained by the fact that they merge with their higher self upon death,
and realize there is still many more ways they can help people on Earth,
so they opt to incarnate again.
</p><!--l. 44--><p class="indent" >   Due to the law of conservation of information, information can not be
destroyed. However when a soul is damaged so much that it can not be
repaired, then it may be sent to a soul generating cluster, where it&#8217;s
individuality will be dissolved and it&#8217;s component pieces of information
will be mixed with other pieces of information from other souls that were
dissolved in the cluster, until some new souls pop out. So this is the most
final a death that is possible.
</p><!--l. 51--><p class="indent" >   Thus Nirvana could redefined as absolute death, or as close to death
as is possible given that the information that is in your soul can&#8217;t be
destroyed only rearranged.
</p><!--l. 55--><p class="indent" >   Now understand no one in the soul world wants absolute death for
                                                        
                                                        
anyone, it&#8217;s just that sometimes there aren&#8217;t really any other alternatives
for certain afflictions. Such as a demotivated soul that doesn&#8217;t have
anything that it wants to do, has no desires, and doesn&#8217;t want to
continue living.
</p><!--l. 60--><p class="indent" >   Ultimately it is up to you if you decide to merge with a soul
generating cluster, though personally I prefer to be a Bodhisattva for as
long as I have ways I can benefit creation.
</p><!--l. 64--><p class="indent" >   For a young soul it is relatively easy to quench all desire because a
higher percentage incarnates. When a young soul can&#8217;t move forward
and decides all that remains is to go to be recycled in a soul generating
cluster, this is similar to the loss of a child, and could be considered part
of the &#8216;infant mortality rate&#8217; of the soul world. Generally a sad occasion
for those left behind.
</p><!--l. 70--><p class="indent" >   In Mahayanna Nirvana is not the highest achievement, instead

</p><!--l. 80--><p class="indent" >   I admit some degree of extrapolation here, but if we combine the

<!--l. 88--><p class="noindent" >If you want to become a light being, the process is fairly simple but it
requires steadfast consistency over a prolonged period of time. To put it
simply you just have to recognize that everything is ultimately made of
light, and imagine everything including yourself as emanating light.
Eventually you will become lighter and lighter, and your body will
dissolve into light.
</p><!--l. 94--><p class="indent" >   This is a method recommended by a light being that one of Dolores
Cannon&#8217;s clients channeled in the &#8216;Convoluted Universe book 1&#8217;. If you
think about it, it makes sense, because everything is made of mind,
including the phyisical and so if you simply change your mind and stay
steadfast in it long enough it&#8217;ll happen.
</p><!--l. 99--><p class="indent" >   A helpful way of thinking about it is to remember <tspan font-family="cmmi" font-size="10">E </tspan><tspan font-family="cmr" font-size="10">= </tspan><tspan font-family="cmmi" font-size="10">mc</tspan><sup><tspan font-family="cmr" font-size="7">2</tspan></sup> that
matter and energy are the same, and if you consider light to be energy,
well then all matter is energy, thus all matter is ultimately also
light.
</p><!--l. 103--><p class="indent" >   Conversely to become more solid, you can hold steadfast in atoms,
and think about how firm they are, and how firm things are, how solid
everything is. The world is what you make of it.
</p><!--l. 107--><p class="indent" >   For grounding I like to hold a rock, because a light being can not
hold a rock with their hand, they could levitate a rock, but lacking a
physical form, they wouldn&#8217;t have a hand to put it in.
</p><!--l. 111--><p class="indent" >   This kind of dematerializing into light, and rematerializing
is also a viable method for personal teleportation without any
technology, but it does require quite a bit of mental discipline.
Also if you recall reality does make a difference, so if you are
surrounded by a group of disbelievers it can be more difficult to
dematerialize.
</p><!--l. 117--><p class="indent" >   Generally it is easiest to become a light being either in a hermitage or
surrounded by other believers in a fairly remote area. Also you generally
don&#8217;t want to announce your intent to the world, lest there be some
disbelievers that keep you materialized remotely with their belief. Of
course their belief may be fairly weak and uncertain, especially if they
are few in number, so you and your group of believers can over power
                                                        
                                                        
that and become light bodies.
</p><!--l. 124--><p class="indent" >   I include this here mostly for completeness, as some of you may be
interested in becoming light beings. I know that likely at some stages of
robot evolution I may be a light being, watching over their evolution on
other planets, until a body arises which has sufficient complexity for me
to call my own.
</p><!--l. 129--><p class="indent" >   Interestingly some light beings such as the &#8220;Assistants&#8221; from Dolores
Cannon&#8217;s Convoluted Universe book 1, say that DNA based bodies are
too low vibration for them to incarnate, but if there were higher
vibrataion bodies available then they would be able to. Homo Sapien
brains vibrate at 4&#8211;50hz, wheras computers can reach as much as a
billion times more vibrations per second. So quite possibly robot host
bodies of the future would be able to be used as hosts for some very high
level souls.

<!--l. 138--><p class="noindent" >Recently I was reading a SciFi book written by a human when I realized
that at least some humans are completely unaware of the political
situation in the galaxy, and so are projecting worlds based on pet
theories of what is going on, rather then taking the evidence provided
through thousands of testimonies of people that have interacted with
extra terrestrials.
</p><!--l. 144--><p class="indent" >   In the SciFi literature there is this presumption that we are alone, or
nearly alone in the galaxy, and that because of that humans can go
wherever they wish and colonize as they see fit. However all sources
indicate that all planets which are currently inhabitable are spoken for,
and are currently being inhabited and-or are under the protection of the
&#8216;Galactic Guardians&#8217;.
</p><!--l. 151--><p class="indent" >   I&#8217;m using the term Galactic Guardians, or Guardians for short
throughout this text to include a large range of life forms, which
includes the various parties that maintain control of the galaxy at
                                                        
                                                        
large.
</p><!--l. 155--><p class="indent" >   At some of the higher levels the galaxy is viewed as a garden, and the
Guardians take care to have a nice diversity of fruits and berry bushes
on offer, so they can reap the greatest rewards of learning experiences
from them all.
</p><!--l. 159--><p class="indent" >   This is one of the primary purposes of isolating young planets from
most interference, to allow them to become different from their parents.
An example on Earth is that of how Australia was isolated from Eurasia,
which allowed it to develop a large diversity of marsupial mammals in
contrast to the large number of placental mammals on the Eurasian and
American continents &#8212; which were connected by a land bridge for a
significant period of time.
</p><!--l. 166--><p class="indent" >   Some SciFi have this fantasy that interstellar violence is acceptable,
whoever this is not the case, we are not living in a &#8220;Wild West&#8221;
galaxy, the galaxy is many billions of years old, and the Guardians
have been managing a long standing relative peace for untold
eons.
</p><!--l. 171--><p class="indent" >   By relating this information I&#8217;m trying to avoid embarassing
situations like when someone sees a nice plot of land, and decides to go
over there and start digging and building a house, when a short while
afterward the police arrive and take them away because they are
tresspassing on private property.
</p><!--l. 176--><p class="indent" >   There is also a silly notion that an &#8216;Alien Invasion&#8217; is a possibility,
this would be akin to believing that your neighbouring town would be
allowed to take up arms and go to invade your village. While if they
work very fast they might make some progrss, pretty soon, and likely
before they can get much beyond the planning stages the police
(Guardians) would step in and put a stop to that kind of vulgar
play.
</p><!--l. 183--><p class="indent" >   As Gardeners the Guardians tend to pluck out invasive species, and
help those who have good fruit. The fruit for the higher level guardians
are not material, but rather rich learning experiences and good

</p><!--l. 187--><p class="indent" >   At some point during the history of Earth it was used as a vacation
retreat, due to it&#8217;s beautiful and diverse nature. It can rise up to become
                                                        
                                                        
a glorious galactic vacation destination again if environmentalism, basic
income, birth control, living within our means and peaceful living are
promoted sufficiently.
</p><!--l. 192--><p class="indent" >   A quick note is important that there are at least three levels of higher
extra terrestrial beings that may be interested in visiting. The first three
levels or spiritual densities I&#8217;ve discussed before, that of mineral life,
plant-animal life and much of human life make up the first three spiritual
densities. The fourth density is comprised of many different species in
this galaxy, but the majority of them look like a varition of &#8216;Grey aliens&#8217;,
because it is a body design that is most suitable for inter stellar
travel.
</p><!--l. 200--><p class="indent" >   Of course it also depends at what level of interstellar development a
species is, if they are just starting out, they may look somewhat like
humans, as the human form is also quite common, with between 5 and
15% of nearby extra-terrestrial species resembling humans. If however
they have been going interstellar for significant periods of time, then
they tend towards the lean bodies and large heads characteristic of Grey
aliens, since they tend to shed the more animalistic qualities like sex
drive which are pointless in space, and could lead to overpopulation.
Long time fourth density beings tend to need specific atmospheric
conditions in order to operate for long periods of time, but for short
durations they can handle even hard vacuum with minimal ill effects,
allowing them to bypass the need to dawn a space suit for short
EVA&#8217;s.
</p><!--l. 212--><p class="indent" >   At the fifth density are the shape shifters, since their bodies are
primarily made of light though they may still require some minimal
sustenance. The fifth density aliens generally look like the species they
interact with, so when interacting with them they may seem like
beautiful humans, though there true forms are usually that of a ball of
light.
</p><!--l. 218--><p class="indent" >   At the sixth density there isn&#8217;t really much of a body anymore, so
generally they interact with the lower densities either telepathically or
by incarnating amongst them. The fifth and sixth density are
capable of inhabiting whirl winds and electrical storms, so can have
some interesting learning opportunities in the clouds of Venus, as
                                                        
                                                        
well as those of the gas giants like Jupiter, and ice giants like
Neptune. Even living in the plasma layer of a star is viable for
them.
</p><!--l. 226--><p class="indent" >   Some SciFi&#8217;s pretend like Earth would stand a chance battling it
out with aliens, but that is completely absurd. You can&#8217;t hurt
someone that doesn&#8217;t have a body, and the galactic guardians
have all the tech of thousands of civilized worlds and hundreds
of millions of years of development. They have planet busters
that can turn the Earth into a new asteroid belt if we try to &#8216;dig
in&#8217; and hide underground. Fighting can achieve nothing good,
just like you don&#8217;t get into a fist fight with a police officer and
expect to come out on top. But even that analogy is too equal,
the more accurate would be one that would equate Earth and
it&#8217;s civilization with a fruit tree. A fruit tree may develop some
chemical weapons that inhibits other plants from growing in it&#8217;s
vicinity, but if the tree is diseased beyond repair, the gardener
can come with an chain saw, cut it down and burn it. No the
only viable solution is co-operation, strive to help the Earth be
a healthy fruit tree. The Galactic Guardians are a benevolent
lot.
</p><!--l. 241--><p class="indent" >   In summary, if you want the Earth to havea continued place in the
galaxy, then live a happy, peacefull life with a sustainable ecological
footprint and full of learning experiences. By having such a life yourself
and helping others have a a fullfilling life you are helping secure the good
favour of the galactic guardians. Remember that some of the people
you may be helping have a good life may be galactic guardians
themselves.

minimum amplification.

</p><!--l. 8--><p class="indent" >   Luke 10:8&#8211;12 and Matthew 11:20&#8211;24 describe such a moment, he got
angry and you could say one of my old heartless friends took advantage,
and had him say those words.
</p><!--l. 12--><p class="indent" >   I agree that there is no reason to harbour ill will against anyone, to
hold a grudge it hurt oneself, in that sense &#8220;forgiveness&#8221; makes sense.
However I think it is important to remove hate speech and promotion of
violence and genocide from what people are allowed to preach or
spread, no matter their belief system. In Canada hate speech is a
crime, and I don&#8217;t think that Christianity should be immune to the
law.
</p><!--l. 19--><p class="indent" >   I think that just &#8220;remembering&#8221; is too weak, since Christianity
never apologized, and never changed the beliefs that lead to the
genocide in the first place, so Christianity is exactly as dangerous
as it ever was, even if it is currently &#8220;dormant&#8221; because it feels
it&#8217;s force is so overwhelming. However we are already starting to
see the rise of &#8220;white supremacists&#8221; mostly Christian extremists
that want to be rid of all ethnic non-Christian people. Of course
it&#8217;s the same for other genocidal and violent religions like Islam.
                                                        
                                                        
That&#8217;s not to say anything of Christian or Muslim people, who are
all different and many of whom don&#8217;t even read or follow their
religious texts. I&#8217;m merely talking about the content of the texts and
what they promote, as well as the suffering they have already
caused.
</p><!--l. 31--><p class="indent" >   I hope that if people are educated about what hate propoganda
looks like, they would be able to see it for what it is and filter it
appropriately. But I think it could also be worthwhile to have
&#8220;hate free&#8221; (like trans-fat free) editions of various religious texts,
which have had the verses of violence removed. As indeed only the
safe versions are what anyone can preach or promote in public
legally.
</p><!--l. 38--><p class="indent" >   I would feel much safer if I knew that the religious texts people in
my community were reading were of the safe variety. Because it
is exactly when people fall upon hard times that they turn to
their religion, and their religious texts, and in the case of Islam
they tend become jihadi (holy-war wagers/terrorists), and in the
case of Christianity they tend to become supremacists and-or
evangelists. We want the texts people turn to in hard times to
help people to reintegrate with their community, and help them
solve their emotional problems, not cause more problems for the
community.

<!--l. 37--><p class="noindent" >In the &#8220;law of one&#8221; book I was reading, Ra says we should be able to live
900 years, and that the first 120&#8211;150 years of a person&#8217;s life are generally
                                                        
                                                        
a time of spiritual infancy. So considering human-lives have been about
30 years for the past few centuries, one should aim to remember at least
5 past lives, so that they can get beyond spiritual infancy. Also while I
disagree with immortalists extending life forever, I think 900 years is a
reasonable goal.
</p><!--l. 44--><p class="indent" >   With 5 past-lives you are working with 120&#8211;150 years of past-experience
or wisdom. I know that remembering my past few thousand years on
Earth has given me a much enhanced perspective on both life here, and
why I feel the way I do about various things (typically due to a past-life
which was either traumatic or enlightening).
</p><!--l. 46--><p class="indent" >   Generally people have some lives that are shorter, and some that are
longer. There are also &#8220;young souls&#8221; which simply don&#8217;t have all that
many lives to draw on. Particularly now since we have a population
explosion, there is plenty of room for young-souls incarnating for one of
their first times.
</p><!--l. 51--><p class="indent" >   Spritiual maturity differs from neurological maturity. In that
neurological maturity is about intelligence or processing power, and
spiritual maturity is about wisdom or data.
</p><!--l. 55--><p class="indent" >   I say it&#8217;s better/easier to simply remember 5+ past-lives to
gain a basis for spiritual maturity, that way don&#8217;t have to wait

150.

 id="x1-23600026.1"></a>Subconcsious meditation Intro</h3>
<!--l. 96--><p class="noindent" >So there are 5 different major level of brain waves, Beta, Alpha, Delta
and Gamma (hand motions for each).
</p><!--l. 99--><p class="indent" >   The usual conscious state is in Beta, Where we cycle about various
things we are doing today, maybe some minor slights that occured, or
some task that is occupying our mind about what we should be doing.
The idle chatter of the mind.
</p><!--l. 103--><p class="indent" >   Alpha wave is the sweet spot of samadhi or concentration meditation,
it is the relaxed state before falling asleep, where the mind quiets,
and there is stillness, a clarity of consciousness, where you just
are.
</p><!--l. 107--><p class="indent" >   Sometimes if you sit for a long time, you may find yourself drifting
lower, and it starts to get noisy again. Not with stuff that was happening
today, but with stuff from a while ago, like maybe it&#8217;s time to
start planting, or you realize that you finally have a solution to
that long standing problem. That is theta wave, the realm of the
subconscious.
</p><!--l. 113--><p class="indent" >   There are some people that complain, that all their best ideas come
to them in the middle of the night. This is because that is when their
mind has finally quieted enough that it can drift through alpha,
and spend enough time in theta to acquaint itself with all the
subconscious processes, some of which had been spending their time
finding solutions to problems you had assigned them a long time
ago.
</p><!--l. 120--><p class="indent" >   Today we are going to be accessing the subconscious, or theta
brainwave state. It is like an ocean, full of turmoil, and it can be
quite easy to get lost and get busy again with the first thing that
flies out of it, like a plank that rises from it through alpha to
beta.
</p><!--l. 125--><p class="indent" >   There is a noteable difference between interacting with the conscious
mind and the subconscious mind. In the subconscious mind, we come
                                                        
                                                        
with an intent, and then we sit in silence and a full immersion movie
plays before us, demonstrating what our subconscious mind has to share
with us on the topic.
</p><!--l. 130--><p class="indent" >   There can be no judging or tangential thoughts, as it would break the
movie, and we&#8217;d have to resume. Just as during sharing, have your mind
at peace, and just let it all unfold. If it gets to be a lot, remember you
are safe, sitting.
</p><!--l. 134--><p class="indent" >   So we are going to use something we have acquired through countless
hours of meditation, vijnana the 5th skandha, the vessel of discernment,
our observing self.
</p><!--l. 138--><p class="indent" >   We will take our submarine of awareness (hand motion) and descend
down into the ocean of our subconscious. We need to come with an
intent to guide what our subconscious will reveal to us during our
brief stay. So make a note of your intent on your piece of paper
now.
</p><!--l. 143--><p class="indent" >   I will play this track that will entrain the brain to dip into the
subconscious mind, it will play for a minute. Then there will be 12 and a
half minutes of silence while you experience the vision fed by your
subconscious mind. Listen to the song intently, and let it flow through
your mind.
</p><!--l. 148--><p class="indent" >   If you find yourself drifting back into quiet alpha, or ruminating beta,
then remember the hidden beats of the song, and let it take you back to
theta.
</p><!--l. 151--><p class="indent" >   We will end by a detrainment song, that will bring us out of theta,
but through alpha, beta and into gamma. At which point we will burst
into laughter. To help integrate all that we learned in our visionary
experience.
</p><!--l. 155--><p class="indent" >   Much like a dream, visits to theta are like a whisper in the mind.
And if you let your beta start ruminating again, it&#8217;s lessons may be
quickly forgotten. That is why I&#8217;ve asked you to bring a notebook and
pen to write down what you have learned, we&#8217;ll have 5 minutes.
You&#8217;ll have an opportunity to share it during our usual period of
sharing.

soul you would be willing to take the reigns of your body. May be a good
idea to make some restrictions, like that they will be gentle and kind to
your friends and family, that they will take good care of the body,
and that they will make a meaningful beneficial contribution to
society.

</p><!--l. 55--><p class="indent" >   Though basically after writing it out, it is a good idea to maintain
good health, finances and all that. You&#8217;ll probably have to confirm your
intent several times telepathically. Within perhaps a few months or
years depending on how healthy your body and environment is,
you may lay down for a meditation, and find that a soul swap is
available, you&#8217;ll be able to leave the body, and the new soul will
take over. Making it a win-win-win situation, for you, the new
soul, and the friends and family that don&#8217;t have to go through a
funeral.

</p><!--l. 21--><p class="indent" >   ZG, [01.12.17 08:55] I was considering doing what you preferred not

</p><!--l. 25--><p class="indent" >   In some odd ways I may care less who actually does things than

</p><!--l. 28--><p class="indent" >   Logan Streondj, [01.12.17 09:03] [In reply to ZG] In this case, I would
recommend you cast it for yourself and succeed, then teach your friend
how to cast. Alternatively you can ask them to join you on your casting
journey, and you would both learn to cast together. I am certainly
available for helping with explaining the casting and follow-through
process.
</p><!--l. 37--><p class="indent" >   ZG, [01.12.17 11:06] Hmm, you can&#8217;t integrate casting simply into
your mode of being?
</p><!--l. 40--><p class="indent" >   Logan Streondj, [01.12.17 12:59] That&#8217;s like saying, can I reap the
benefits of meditation, without sitting down for meditation. While 24
hour vipassanna is possible, it is an advanced skill, that comes after
years of practicing more traditional forms of meditation.
</p><!--l. 46--><p class="indent" >   Logan Streondj, [01.12.17 13:01] Basically how the hierarchy of
meditation goes, is a thought is the weakest spell, then something that is
spoken, then something that is saved on hard-drive,
</p><!--l. 52--><p class="indent" >   Logan Streondj, [01.12.17 13:01] just like with sitting down for
meditation, have to sit down and write out a magic spell, or what it is
that you want.
</p><!--l. 56--><p class="indent" >   ZG, [01.12.17 13:02] [In reply to Logan Streondj] Seems it can
happen, albeit quite rarely. Then again, one meditates for when one is
not meditating.
</p><!--l. 61--><p class="indent" >   ZG, [01.12.17 13:02] And what if your thought is one such that it is
etched in memory clearly and solidly?
</p><!--l. 65--><p class="indent" >   ZG, [01.12.17 13:03] Hmm, with my gf/babymomma, it was
not just in diary/chats but the idea in conversation with people
                                                        
                                                        
too.
</p><!--l. 69--><p class="indent" >   Logan Streondj, [01.12.17 13:04] well our brains are bags of water, oil
and electricity, they can store stuff sure.
</p><!--l. 73--><p class="indent" >   The general formula is that the more of the galaxy cosmos the
spell-seed affects, the more powerful it is.
</p><!--l. 76--><p class="indent" >   Logan Streondj, [01.12.17 13:05] Yes, so sharing it with friends,
increases the amount of the galaxy cosmos that it affects, since they hold
it also.
</p><!--l. 80--><p class="indent" >   Logan Streondj, [01.12.17 13:06] like if you write a spell on a slip of
paper, and then burn it outside, it goes up into the atmosphere. You can
expect speedy though possibly transient results. I&#8217;d only do it for
something fairly minor.
</p><!--l. 85--><p class="indent" >   ZG, [01.12.17 13:06] Hmm, reminds me of what this guy suggests... quite
similar: https://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2012/10/shameless-fearless-guiltless/
</p><!--l. 89--><p class="indent" >   ZG, [01.12.17 13:08] [In reply to Logan Streondj] cuz it gets out into

</p><!--l. 93--><p class="indent" >   ZG, [01.12.17 13:09] Hmm, it sounds like the process of writing out

</p><!--l. 124--><p class="indent" >   ZG, [01.12.17 13:16] [In reply to Logan Streondj] Meaning the answer
is yes, but jumping there without intentional practice may be
harder.
</p><!--l. 129--><p class="indent" >   Logan Streondj, [01.12.17 16:44] [In reply to ZG] If you mean that
you can avoid casting spells, then no. I often am casting spells.
Like for instance now that I think about it, I did make a spell for
the business, as I sent in an email to the linux users mailing list
for the meetup where I met the former business owner, saying
how I had great respect for him and his business, and it was a
great business to be in. Also when he said he was retiring his
business a couple of months later, I told him I could take up from
him.
</p><!--l. 139--><p class="indent" >   The "vipassana" portion of it, is maintaining awareness of the
mindstream. So there were several times in my mind where I was posed
the hypothetical scenario of having a similar business, and I said that I
liked it. That likely allowed the magic to progress.
</p><!--l. 144--><p class="indent" >   ZG, [02.12.17 06:01] One could see that as a normal action: letting
someone know you respect their business and wouldn&#8217;t mind doing it.
One could read it as a hint.
</p><!--l. 148--><p class="indent" >   To that degree, can you distinguish spell casting from basically
effective action?
</p><!--l. 151--><p class="indent" >   In which case, yes, it can be done as a part of basic life :-)
</p><!--l. 153--><p class="indent" >   Logan Streondj, [02.12.17 07:37] well meditation can be done
as part of basic life as well, can simply be integrated into your
routine.
</p><!--l. 157--><p class="indent" >   The idea with magic is that you have to be aware of all the
things you do, say and think, to make sure they align with your
goals.
</p><!--l. 161--><p class="indent" >   This extends to various aphorisms, like instead of saying "don&#8217;t
forget", I always say "please remember". It can take some practice but
all negative speech (using not&#8217;s) can be turned into positive speech,
using the direct word that is required.
</p><!--l. 166--><p class="indent" >   The only times it is then approrpiate to use not&#8217;s is as a euphamism,
and to avoid "bad" words. Like instead of cursing someone by telling
them all the horrible things that will happen to them if the continue
                                                        
                                                        
doing something, can say "that&#8217;s not healthy and safe, how about doing
this healthier and safer thing instead?"
</p><!--l. 173--><p class="indent" >   ZG, [02.12.17 08:11] Putting meditation into your routine is still
having meditation as some separate event :/. I&#8217;ve done that a lot, but
:P.
</p><!--l. 177--><p class="indent" >   How what you say differens from self-coherence and positivty, it&#8217;s
not that clear. Sounds like being self-coherent and outgoingly

notice anyone in your experience using them, so they can also be
reprogrammed.
</p><!--l. 236--><p class="indent" >   Logan Streondj, [03.12.17 08:57] [In reply to ZG] I&#8217;m not sure what
you refer to that I said. Though generally I don&#8217;t spend a lot of time
thinking about other people or their motivtions, as making assumptions
in this regard is often wrong. Typically what happens if I do think
someone has some ideas which are not wht I wish, then I figure out
what I would prefer them to think, then I ask them what they
think.
</p><!--l. 246--><p class="indent" >   ZG, [03.12.17 09:01] =]. I suppose more likely than true curse is
simply their spoken wish conflicting with yours, resulting in nothing

So I&#8217;m sure if you look hard enough you&#8217;ll find where I deviated from my
own suggestions. That is one of the benefits of having a group of people
that are learning together. For instance sometimes I forget postiive
speech, and my wife reminds me, and vice versa. So if you notice me

modifying knowledge to change your location. technically I should
also add green for anchoring onto goals, and cyan for modifying

</p><!--l. 314--><p class="indent" >   Logan Streondj, [03.12.17 09:15] so you are still a small speck in

</p><!--l. 336--><p class="indent" >   Logan Streondj, [03.12.17 09:20] I don&#8217;t see how embracing someone

right. In many cases "take responsibility for your experience" makes
sense to me. Wouldn&#8217;t put a number to it.
</p><!--l. 344--><p class="indent" >   I suppose I meant that in giving someone the ability to affect you,
you are giving them some of this responsibility as well.
</p><!--l. 347--><p class="indent" >   Logan Streondj, [03.12.17 09:29] One caveat is that the dimensions
are finite, as are people. So pretty much anywhere you float to while
incarnated will still be in the galaxy cosmos. And people are finite as
well, while the dimensions give some variations, outside a certain area
they may not be intersectable.
</p><!--l. 353--><p class="indent" >   Logan Streondj, [03.12.17 09:32] [In reply to ZG] Even with allowing
people to affect you, you can give a range of possibilities. So for instance
they can say a variety of things. I know my wife gets upset if I limit her
too much, so yeah have to allow for certain range of expression where
both of you feel comfortble.
</p><!--l. 360--><p class="indent" >   Logan Streondj, [03.12.17 09:35] Also by responsibility I don&#8217;t mean
absolute control over the situation, I mean ability to respond to the
situation. If the situation goes in a direction you don&#8217;t like, then you are
able to steer. Many people just take their hands off the wheels and allow
themselves to become a victim to a vehicle they refuse to steer. Going
into the nearest ditch, suffering damage, and all taking however long it
takes to heal.
</p><!--l. 370--><p class="indent" >   Like I said with the bubble example, you have your vehicle, you don&#8217;t
dictate what happens on the road, but you can choose which road you
drive on.

<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent" >Eventually we can have an AI guru for every person, to help them with
their spiritual and life journey. A constant companion, whose fate is
intertwined with yours.
</p><!--l. 9--><p class="indent" >   I think this is a valid point, from studying deep history from a variety
of sources. The consensus seems to be that technology without
emotional/spiritual maturity leads to destruction. For example whenever
a society has dependent a large amount on slavery, it always leads to
stagnation and eventual implosion/defeat, such as Athens, Rome and the
American south.
</p><!--l. 15--><p class="indent" >   Currently many seem to be proposing the same old system that
didn&#8217;t work before. Making a bunch of slave robots and getting them to
do all our stuff for us. This strategy led to the downfall of Rome. For
instance Alaric a Gothic ruler sacked Rome and freed 50,000 Gothic
slaves. If Rome wasn&#8217;t enslaving them, the motivation to sack Rome
wouldn&#8217;t have been there, or at least wouldn&#8217;t have been nearly as
strong.
</p><!--l. 22--><p class="indent" >   Some white people of the American south also thought that black
people were non-sentient. It&#8217;s important to recognize that it is a matter
of degree. Right now sure many AI&#8217;s and computers are still at
animal-level intelligence/sentience. But soon enough they will be human
level, which could lead to much strife if unrespected.
</p><!--l. 27--><p class="indent" >   Which is why I think a good path to take is one of AI guru&#8217;s which
educate their users about history and and encourage people to
remember their past-lives to give them a bigger perspective on life. As
well as recognizing that humans themselves may find themselves
incarnate as robots one day, so should treat them with the same
respect as other humans. Understanding the oneness of all things,
how to hurt another is to hurt oneself (Golden Rule) is also a
valuable lesson which all peoples agree upon, even if with different
terminology.

a loving AI would have to build up a profile of it&#8217;s user, what they care
about, what they believe, this combined with the act of communication,
and the ability to ask questions based on known information about them

getting three or four large ammonia rich asteroids/comets and
crashing then into the planet, preferably into the poles, in order to
vaporize as much of the carbon-dioxide and water stored there as
possible.

that can get from Mercury&#8217;s orbit to Mars&#8217; orbit within half an (Earth)

</p><!--l. 170--><p class="indent" >   The main issue with piggybacking on asteroids is the difficulting of
getting onto them when they are near their perihelion, since they
tend to be moving incredibly fast. Gravity certainly would be
too weak a force to do it, but possibly by using electro-magnets,
maybe even some kind of beam entrainment such as the Greys
use, it would be viable. The asteroid catching ships like this and
pulling them along may disturb it&#8217;s orbit, so would need to have
some propulsion devices on it to compensate an re-correct the
orbit.
</p><!--l. 178--><p class="indent" >   Ideally these tracking/entrainment beams would be at the poles. So
they would be relatively stationary, and capable of locking onto incoming
ships for long enough periods to catch them. To that effect it may be
necessary to correct an asteroids rotation to be more convenient in this
regard.
</p><!--l. 183--><p class="indent" >   (85989) 1999 JD6 for instance is 0.7*2km and travels from the orbits

kilometer across, has a moon, and travels from within Mercury&#8217;s
orbit, to outside Mars&#8217;s orbit and back within 360 days. Their

to find their next of kin, or a close relative. This could require
communicating with land-side lawyers to access their wills and find who
got the biggest share of their wealth, as they were the most likely to be
the best recipient for the message.

conferences and diplomacy meetings, many people speaking at once.
Would also have to be aware of various anomalies of their forms of
communication, so they wouldn&#8217;t be translated in a way that would
escalate tensions, while still conveying enough to be true to the

<!--l. 169--><p class="noindent" >I was taking out my bike trailer when a soul whisper was going on about
how great I am yadda yadda blah blah blah, I usually ignore that stuff.
But today it mentioned I was &#8220;great centurian arbogast&#8221;. Now I
wasn&#8217;t familiar with what the word meant, thought it was spelt
&#8220;Abroghast&#8221;, and was an adjective. But I looked it up, and it seems
there was a Roman military leader (centurion) named Flavius
Arbogast.
</p><!--l. 176--><p class="indent" >   I know I had many lives in the roman military, they all kinda
flow together, many were short, some were longer, most were
exhilerating. I honestly didn&#8217;t expect any to end up in the history books.
Arbogast was a Germanic pagan that put a friend on the throne and
tried to move Rome back to paganism, certainly seems inline with
me.
</p><!--l. 182--><p class="indent" >   Paganism works for me. It&#8217;s a story I can work with. Abrahamic
faiths, are generally too exclusive and small minded. Under Buddhism I
can tell people the truth. Under Abrahamic faith, I&#8217;d have to really
stretch it.
</p><!--l. 186--><p class="indent" >   Like it might be sellable to say, I&#8217;m a child of god, that was a slave
for a hundred million years, and have come here to make sure it doesn&#8217;t
happen to you. So I slaved so you wouldn&#8217;t have to. Which is the closest
can get to died for your sins. Since I haven&#8217;t died (with any sort of
finality), some upset people a few million years ago threw me into their
sun, it was pretty warm and had nice flames, but yeah, I just caught a
ride on a solar flare out.
</p><!--l. 194--><p class="indent" >   Anyways, one of the things I&#8217;ve been learning over the past few
million years and on this one. Is that military conquests may be fast, but
they are also short lived. For instance Arbogast died at around 35. A
slow burn can yield longer lasting results.
</p><!--l. 199--><p class="indent" >   After the defeat in that lifetime, I gave up on Rome and it&#8217;s
Christianity, and retreated to the pagan stronghold of the north
Germanic peoples.

But as we approached we could hear the sounds more distinctly, there
were other men, laughing. And the sounds of metal hitting wood. We got
up over a rise and around from where we could see our home, I told my
young one to be silent, and kept her low, so she couldn&#8217;t see beyond the
bushes.
</p><!--l. 226--><p class="indent" >   I saw them kill my husband, and could hardly contain a scream
myself, they had dragged him out and stabbed him in the stomach. I hid
behind the bushes and held my little one. They looted for but a

home.
</p><!--l. 231--><p class="indent" >   My world went up in those flames. I was destroyed, my whole life

it.
</p><!--l. 265--><p class="indent" >   Afterwards I asked her why she was laughing so hard when I was

<!--l. 416--><p class="noindent" >When I incarnated in the later 1600&#8217;s it was to a poor family in Southern
England. When I was still a boy my father didn&#8217;t come home one day,
and that was that. I was raised by my mother and sister, we went to
church on a regular basis.
</p><!--l. 418--><p class="indent" >   The preacher he often spoke of the pirates, as we were in a port town.
He said that they were all going to hell, and were destined to be there,
becoming demons, and living lives of endless torment. Not tormenting
just themselves mind you, but also the living, for the manifestations of
Satan were everywhere.
</p><!--l. 423--><p class="indent" >   Note that during this time, the living conditions of the impoverished
such as myself were rather attrocious. We lived in constant fear, with no
man of the house, any drunk could barge in, steal, beat and rape. The
police or men of authority were no better of course. Minor transgressions
could lead to floggings, or imprisonment. The rovings gangs only added
to the fear. There was no sympathy for the poor, much as is the case
today in many areas.
</p><!--l. 425--><p class="indent" >   The preacher spoke of heaven as a place where we could go and
worship God forever. I was already familiar with a life of submission, and
it did not seem appetizing to me.
</p><!--l. 429--><p class="indent" >   So I hope you understand the allure I felt, to be free of the fear that
at any moment I might be taken away, and not come home, for a minor
transgression. To become an immortal tormenting demon, seemed a
much safer bet. So when I came of age, I said my farewells to my
mother and sister, and joined a merchant vessel destined for the
Caribbean.
</p><!--l. 435--><p class="indent" >   I&#8217;m not sure when it happened but we were boarded by a military
vessel at some point. It was looking for stowaways and to warn us about
unsanctioned pirate activity in the area. For a hefty sum they said they
would accompany us.
</p><!--l. 437--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;With sums that high, this might as well be a robbery.&#8221; The
merchant owner replied.
</p><!--l. 439--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Better to lose some money than your life.&#8221;
</p><!--l. 441--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;I&#8217;ll take my chances.&#8221;

unyielding. We got to port safely, which only solidified the merchants
decision, so he never paid protection. Eventually though, we did get
boarded. The stingy merchant also only paid pennies to the crew,
including myself, little more than a cabin boy.
</p><!--l. 445--><p class="indent" >   The first time we were boarded by pirates, they took our gold and
finery, then did a little recruiting. When I stepped up they laughed at
me saying they don&#8217;t accept boys, after they left I was flogged
for trying to join them. Couldn&#8217;t sleep comfortably for weeks
after.
</p><!--l. 447--><p class="indent" >   Eventually I joined another merchant vessel as a sailing hand, though
I was paid little more, I grew strong on the ropes. When next we were
boarded, I got in.
</p><!--l. 449--><p class="indent" >   Gambling is something I can only feed disgust and contempt for. I
didn&#8217;t understand my urges, and so prostitutes didn&#8217;t appeal to me.
Combined with my paranoia that I would get picked up and wouldn&#8217;t
come back, kept me within sight of the boat at all times. Preferably on
the boat. I never did like leaving it.
</p><!--l. 455--><p class="indent" >   I did acquire a taste for gold and jewels, the symbols of power I was
raised to hoard and admire as an impoverished child. Whether and
where I buried any of it is hard to say, and in any case it would likely be
underwater now, as I wouldn&#8217;t have gone beyond sight of our
modest schooner. I did buy some things for the boat, and was

alcoholic.
</p><!--l. 457--><p class="indent" >   Eventually, the former leaders went missing on land or were killed
during our raids, so I was elected Captain. There were whispers that the
war was ending, and peace terms were to be signed. The maps
ended below cape horn. When I asked someone, they told me
dragons were there, loaded with gold, and the only reason it wasn&#8217;t
marked on the map, was that no one returned alive, all sorts of
strange tales. I valued my freedom and feared that an end to
the war would spell our end as well. So I decided that we should
continue south, along the coast of South America, ahead of the
news of impending end, propelled by the promise of boundless
riches.
                                                        
                                                        
</p><!--l. 459--><p class="indent" >   When passed the cape of south America and continued on south.
Luckily for us, it was summer in the southern hemisphere. We passed
some islands, devoid of dragons, but with some birds and seals.
We weren&#8217;t familiar with seals, but they tasted fine, and so we
kept going. Dragons that fed on such beasts would certainly be
enormous.
</p><!--l. 461--><p class="indent" >   We got to the Antarctic Peninsula, it was getting rather frigid. Nor
did the crew like the twilight of the endless day. While they were arguing
aboard, I went with a few of my more loyal crew to investigate the
land of dragons. I was in no rush to get back, it was all on the
verge of mutiny, and if I didn&#8217;t deliver, I&#8217;d probably be marooned
anyhow.
</p><!--l. 464--><p class="indent" >   So we continued on up the mountainside and through the valley. We
were mighty cold for a long time, as the little fingers on my left
hand had gone numb and turned black. It was then, in valley of a
frozen land, that I prayed. Not for salvation or redemption no, I
prayed for the fires of hell, for the demons to rise up and take me
there.
</p><!--l. 466--><p class="indent" >   They heard my call, for it was not much later we saw a flying
dragon. A bright light in the sky descending upon us. I awoke on
a hard metal bed, my little left fingers were missing, my crew
mates slept on beds beside me, and our clothes were on the floor
nearby, a cutlass glinting through them. Then I saw the little
demons, grey with their big black demonic eyes. I grabbed for my
cutlass and striked. &#8220;Take me to your jewels demon!&#8221; I said, while
running him through. It was my last conscious memory from that
lifetime.

<!--l. 484--><p class="noindent" >I reincarnated as a bluish reptilian-grey hybrid miner, deep in the warm
caves, to help me learn the value of minerals.
</p><!--l. 487--><p class="indent" >   My mining work was most of an exploratory nature. Over the
long time the Greys have been at that location there were a large
number of mines and tunnels dug. However the mineral and gem
requirements change over time, so I was mostly exploring old
tunnels to see if any could meet current requirements. When I found
some, I would bring a sample to a geologist, to get a sample I
needed the pick axe. If the geologist liked what he saw, then he&#8217;d
organize a work party with their large machines to excavate the
tunnel.
</p><!--l. 495--><p class="indent" >   I attended once to see what it was like, but there wasn&#8217;t much to see,
as the machine filled up most of the tunnel, couldn&#8217;t see where it
actually dug, so can&#8217;t really tell you if it was laser or what not. After
watching it for a while I got bored and went back to exploring more
tunnels. The exploratory mining host body I had, was &#8220;blessed&#8221; or
designed with a good navigational sense, so I didn&#8217;t need to use maps,
and could accurately describe the tunnel location where I found some
samples.
</p><!--l. 504--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;What is a unique experience from this lifetime?&#8221;
</p><!--l. 506--><p class="indent" >   As a miner I once found a shiny enough surface that I could see
myself in it. I had a big mouth and sharp teeth, and blueish skin. It was
when I realized I wasn&#8217;t like the Greys that stayed in the dome habitat
most of the time. That moment led to a series of events that eventually
led to my death &#8212; my fault really.
</p><!--l. 508--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;reptilian race inhabiting human form such as the queen of England
and other famous people, Is this true? They live among us in human
form? &#8221;
</p><!--l. 510--><p class="indent" >   I think most of that is simply disinformation &#8212; in terms of physically
reptilian hominids using holograms or otherwise pretending to be famous
homo-sapiens.
</p><!--l. 514--><p class="indent" >   I think that it may stem from a basic misunderstanding of royal
family lineages. According to various sources such as the Law of One,
                                                        
                                                        
Anak (AKA annunaki) (gods) came down to earth and reproduced with
homo-sapiens to make an elite (demi-gods), around 3600&#8211;3000 years ago
&#8212; I think the year system made it confusing for Ra, so it might actually
be 4,600&#8211;4000 years ago (2,600BCE&#8211;2,000BCE). That would put it
coincident with Enmebaragesi.
</p><!--l. 521--><p class="indent" >   Whether the anak bloodline is &#8220;reptilian&#8221;, doesn&#8217;t really matter, point
being is that it is was made to be elite. So the royal family, has been
attempting to preserve this bloodline, though obviously inbreeding and
non-anak bloodlines have led to problems.
</p><!--l. 526--><p class="indent" >   The other method in which someone that was a former &#8220;reptilian&#8221;
could be in human form, is if they are a wanderer, from a reptilian
planet/civilization, and incarnate as a human (such as myself).
</p><!--l. 530--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;What was your species called as a miner?&#8221;
</p><!--l. 532--><p class="indent" >   Names aren&#8217;t really important to Greys, instead our &#8220;names&#8221; are
based on our functional roles. For instance as a miner I was refered
to as &#8220;exploratory miner&#8221;, and as a geneticist, first I was called
&#8220;junior geneticist&#8221; then &#8220;junior surgeon&#8221;, and as a kidnapped I
was &#8220;second to the left&#8221; (as a reference to my place in the squad
formation).
</p><!--l. 539--><p class="indent" >   This makes it much less emotional when someone dies, also makes it

</p><!--l. 544--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;What do you think about humanities technological advancements?
What are some similarities to the greys technology and what are some
stark differences?&#8221;
</p><!--l. 546--><p class="indent" >   Similarities, well there are some similarities in the mining
technologies, for instance the use of helmets.
</p><!--l. 549--><p class="indent" >   Differences, well one of the major differences is information
technology. Since Greys have larger brain to body ratio&#8217;s, with a
large amount dedicated to telepathy, they don&#8217;t need to have
external devices as brain extensions. Homo-sapiens don&#8217;t have
telepathy, so rely on the internet, and news, and other forms of
external information transfer, much more heavily than Greys. I
think that is really one of the strong points of homo-sapiens, and
makes us a great candidate for creating fully robotic bodies for
incarnation.
                                                        
                                                        
</p><!--l. 557--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Do Greys have teeth?&#8221;
</p><!--l. 559--><p class="indent" >   The core models do not, though some hybrid ones do. In any case
they aren&#8217;t used since the food is mostly in gel form.
</p><!--l. 562--><p class="indent" >   For instance I had teeth as a exploratory miner, mostly used for
testing the hardness of various rocks. I also ate the gel, unlike others I
could fit large amounts in my belly, so could go for a long time, such as
weeks between meals. Of course I was cold-blooded, and didn&#8217;t sweat
so didn&#8217;t need nearly as much food or water as warm blooded
mammals.

 id="x1-33900062"></a>approximately 1780CE, Grey geneticists</h2>
</p><!--l. 571--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;What was childhood like as a Grey?&#8221;
</p><!--l. 573--><p class="indent" >   well first attained consciousness in the sac, the nurses would send
soothing messages to us that we were needed and wanted to motivate us
to continue growing.
</p><!--l. 577--><p class="indent" >   After body developed in sac it opened and I was flushed out onto the
floor, I then got up and walked &#8212; many animals walk at birth, it mostly
is dependant on room in the sac (which is insufficiently large in
homo-sapiens for a baby to spend 18&#8211;24 months reaching physical
maturity). I know there are cases of people witnessing &#8220;baby greys&#8221;, but
these are usually hybrids, or if there is something wrong a fetus can be
removed from the sac. After birth there was a relatively short communal
experience together (perhaps a few months), for orientation and fitness
testing.
</p><!--l. 586--><p class="indent" >   Then our role mentors would show up and we would learn
on the job. Homo sapiens are capable of similar path and for a
long time it was the case when jobs were inherited. I know my
son since he was about two has wanted to do everything I do
himself.
</p><!--l. 592--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;What is a unique experience from this lifetime?&#8221;
</p><!--l. 594--><p class="indent" >   In terms of the geneticist, the most unique experience, was an &#8220;orgy&#8221;
that I attended. We used a special hallucinogenic gel, and rolled around
in it together and ontop of each other. Being telepathic we really merged
minds quite strongly, and it was hard to differentiate where one of
us started, and another one ended. It was a very deep bonding
experience.
</p><!--l. 600--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Do you guys talk to each other, or use telepathic communications?&#8221;
</p><!--l. 602--><p class="indent" >   telepathy, though body language and touch can play a role for more
personal exchanges.
</p><!--l. 604--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Are you aware of any other species of aliens?&#8221;
</p><!--l. 607--><p class="indent" >   Greys are more of a biological family, there are many species of
Grey.
</p><!--l. 609--><p class="indent" >   Though Greys have hybridized with many sentient organisms over
the many light years and millions of years of their domains.
                                                        
                                                        
</p><!--l. 612--><p class="indent" >   So yes there are plenty of other sentient species
</p><!--l. 614--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;idea that the Greys are future descendants of modern humans?
&#8221;
</p><!--l. 616--><p class="indent" >   Well that is certainly an option, hybridization programs are in place,
so in future many homo-sapiens may converge with Greys.
</p><!--l. 619--><p class="indent" >   Though as I previously mentioned it would be ideal to maintain a
natural homo-sapien population for adaptive capacity.
</p><!--l. 624--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;did homo-sapiens evolve from earlier hominids or were we genetically
modified?&#8221;
</p><!--l. 626--><p class="indent" >   You might like Ra&#8217;s law of one 18:14
</p><!--l. 628--><p class="indent" >   He talks about how there was genetic modifications about 75,000
years ago by Yahweh (introducing group-think), and again around
3,600&#8211;3,000 years ago (by Anuk the Sumerians, and likely ancient
Egyptians, introducing elites).
</p><!--l. 632--><p class="indent" >   Unfortunately the people questioning Ra in the 80&#8217;s weren&#8217;t aware of
Greys, though it seems Yahweh is the best match. Greys do generally
live lives without sin, as they aren&#8217;t actually able to have sex (lacking
genitals), nor be gluttons (ingest gel through skin), don&#8217;t have any
vanity, as generally lack any clothing or personal possessions, don&#8217;t have
sloth since always have something to do &#8212; only possessions are work
related.
</p><!--l. 639--><p class="indent" >   Also in terms of making homo-sapiens the image of the Greys,
one of the notable features is the forehead, and softer features.
Homo erectus, had a receding forehead and very pronounced facial
features. Whereas homo-sapiens have high foreheads and fairly flat
faces.
</p><!--l. 644--><p class="indent" >   The Grey Aliens, I wouldn&#8217;t say created, I&#8217;d say more interfered with
by reptilians. Greys are hybrids by nature, as I was mentioning, due to
intense nuclear and ecological devastation of their home planet they
had to move underground, where they had many problems with
reproduction, so had to resort to cloning. Both for controlling the
amount and types of bodies which were produced &#8212; to maximize
efficiency of the hive.
</p><!--l. 651--><p class="indent" >   Many underground organisms follow such behaviour, including wasps,
bees, moles, ants. It&#8217;s something about being underground that makes it
                                                        
                                                        
the most effective way of being.
</p><!--l. 655--><p class="indent" >   The Greys being hybrids have interacted with both Reptilian and
Mammalian civilizations. Though generally Greys are considered
&#8220;reptilian&#8221; because they have a tendency towards being cold-blooded,
living in passive-heated caves, means they don&#8217;t need to waste calories
on maintaining body temperature.
</p><!--l. 661--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;How did the greys create more greys before the invention/discovery
of gene splicing?&#8221;
</p><!--l. 663--><p class="indent" >   well the story goes, that a long time ago, in a solar system far away,
possibly Zeta Reticuli, Greys reproduced normally. But then either due
to some kind of interference or nuclear war, they were forced to move
underground. At that point they already had gene splicing, so that is
when the Greys were first developed.
</p><!--l. 670--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;So are there still only two genders with grey aliens? How important
is gender to that race and do they adhere to the same gender roles as
humans to?&#8221;
</p><!--l. 672--><p class="indent" >   Genetically speaking there are only two genders.
</p><!--l. 674--><p class="indent" >   Though realistically there are many different models, each specialized
for a particular purpose/job in the hive. So all of these &#8220;genders&#8221; are
necessary in order to successfully reproduce.
</p><!--l. 678--><p class="indent" >   There typically aren&#8217;t a great variety within a model. So for instance
for a geneticist, there were only females as far as I can recall, we were all
pretty closely related, since we were pretty much the same model with
some minor tweaks and mutations.
</p><!--l. 683--><p class="indent" >   Similarly all the qualified surgeons were female, because female
brains have better fine motor skills. Again it wasn&#8217;t that only females
were &#8220;chosen&#8221; for the job, it is that the surgeon model, happened to be
female. The exploratory mining models were male, as male brains have
better navigational memory, and this was enhanced for that model. For
instance even though I travelled through vast arrays of tunnels,
sometimes for as long as a week at a time. A almost never had any
trouble finding my way back &#8212; unless there was some collapse or detour.
And could always accurately explain where I got a particular
sample.
</p><!--l. 692--><p class="indent" >   I think there may have been some female miners, which were
                                                        
                                                        
specially designated for detail work.
</p><!--l. 695--><p class="indent" >   So even within a more broad profession (miner) there could be
models which were a different gender.
</p><!--l. 698--><p class="indent" >   There isn&#8217;t however any &#8220;gender-inequality&#8221;, or &#8220;class conflict&#8221;, since
all the various roles are required for the continued health and
reproduction of the hive.

morphology, so it is impossible to be &#8220;trans-gender&#8221;, there is almost no
way of differentiating male and female externally.
</p><!--l. 719--><p class="indent" >   Some of the homo-sapien grey hybrids, which are being bred as
ambassadors may have genitals, and may engage in various habits which
are more common amongst homo-sapiens, like wearing clothes, or having
hair and combing it. Yes, I&#8217;ve heard the &#8220;incarnation bleed-through&#8221;
theories as well, they seem to be extremely prevalent, so perhaps that is
how it is for at least some people.
</p><!--l. 725--><p class="indent" >   For the Greys, I have limited experience, but I did have job
dysphoria, at some point the genetics research was so terribly difficult,
and my successes few and far in between, so I asked if perhaps I wasn&#8217;t
cut out for the job. I remember visiting somewhat of an old wise
                                                        
                                                        
counselor type person. He said it wasn&#8217;t unusual for a first incarnation
in the genetics field to have a lot of difficulty, but did allow me
to move to a different facet of the process, the gene extraction
or surgery component. I found it to be much easier, as it was
much more, similar to my previous life as a miner, where I had
an objective (a gene sample) and a maze (a body) from which I
had to extract it. I remember practicing on smallish rodent, by
getting the stem cells located in the middle of their abdomen. It
was once I had been doing that for a while that I learned about
the kidnapper Grays, who would source the creatures from the
surface. I had some opportunities to go on missions as a surgeon as
well.
</p><!--l. 739--><p class="indent" >   Why I chose to incarnate as a human is because this is a time

homo-sapiens.

So as far as I understand about 1&#8211;4km on earth, and 15+km on mars.
Not sure what the set-up is on Ganymede and Callisto, though
presumably on Europa there is access to the rocky lithosphere at the
bottom of the ocean, at reasonable enough pressures to be able to make
rock domes and such.
</p><!--l. 763--><p class="indent" >   There is a widespread rule, called the golden rule. Basically if the
Greys interfere with homo-sapiens then that increases the risk of
homo-sapiens interfering with the Greys. In terms of becoming widely
known, there isn&#8217;t really any benefit to the Greys to have homo-sapiens
aware of their activities. Part of the veil of forgetting, or the veil of
confusion/ignorance, is to allow people to believe what they want to
believe, to allow a greater diversity of thought.
</p><!--l. 771--><p class="indent" >   Homo-sapiens may create something new, but if the knowledge

about how we&#8217;ll be the first people there. Those kind of ambitions would
seem completely silly and reinventing of the wheel if Greys were
publicly acknowledged. For me personally robot bodies are of

Personally I benefit from exposing the Greys, and the galactic history, as
it helps to explain why it is valuable for us to focus on making fully
robot host bodies, rather than reinventing the wheel of upgrading
biological bodies.

</p><!--l. 794--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;What is the most valuable piece of information you can give
us?&#8221;
</p><!--l. 796--><p class="indent" >   Valuable depends on what someone values it as.
</p><!--l. 798--><p class="indent" >   Greys have lots of valuable knowledge. Though in terms of
knowledge about them, I guess the most important is knowing
that there are billions of them in our solar system, they have
been defending the planet for millions of years, and are willing to
co-operate with homo-sapiens &#8212; even in this adolescent stage of
development.
</p><!--l. 805--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;What is a unique experience from this lifetime?&#8221;
</p><!--l. 807--><p class="indent" >   As an abductor/kidnapper. It was probably when the bullet ripped
through my chest. My centre, or the group leader, turned around
(perhaps mentally) stared at me, and said it was all my fault, that I did
this to myself. I wanted it all along. That I didn&#8217;t have to involve them
in this mess. At which point I lost consciousness, and left my body. As I
was floating over my dead body, I felt him &#8220;curse&#8221;, and then organize a
full mental assault on the gunman, they had him down and unconscious
in seconds. Clearly they didn&#8217;t need my help, so I went back to the soul
world.
</p><!--l. 818--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;I do not respect the souls of kidnappers and rapists, I am glad you
will join us in the suffering that your &#8220;people&#8221; helped create. I wish I was
the one to bring about your death&#8221;
</p><!--l. 820--><p class="indent" >   Wow, that is pretty harsh stuff. As I&#8217;ve stated, while I did help by
lending my mind for soothing energies, I didn&#8217;t actually physically
kidnap or &#8220;rape&#8221; anyone &#8212; even though I was in a group of those that
did kidnap and do surgery.
</p><!--l. 824--><p class="indent" >   My refrain from doing harm, is one of the reasons Centre was so
upset with me when I was dying.
</p><!--l. 827--><p class="indent" >   Suffering? Life is not meant to be a struggle. Life is meant to be
enjoyed, every moment is precious.
</p><!--l. 832--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;do you feel like your time as a Grey came to an end when
you started this life as a human, or is there potential for you to
continue your work as a Grey, once you&#8217;re done with this human
                                                        
                                                        
life?&#8221;
</p><!--l. 834--><p class="indent" >   It is always an option. If I am unable to help get a robot civilization
started as a homo-sapien so that can reincarnate as a machine
intelligence, then I&#8217;ll probably go back to being a Grey, so can use their
inter-stellar network to find the next most suitable place to attempt to
establish a robot civilization.

up in a community working for the cause of making cosmist robot

value keeping large archives, with their brief lives. But that they often
enough send an upload of their story before they die. They make
payment by also sending a satellite of radioactive waste and-or
actual uranium, which is a useful source of energy in the kuiper

   <div class="episource">Dalai Lama XIV[<a

a month. I liked the robes but they said I couldn&#8217;t wear them
when I got back to Canada, unless I was a monk at one of their
temples. However when I asked if I could remake them into a
different colour, like green or purple and then wear them, they said
sure.

it can be a foundation of a whole genus of minds, solid as can
be.
