<!--l. 21--><p class="noindent" >Buddhism was chosen because it is the most compatible with
science.
</p><!--l. 23--><p class="indent" >   Also Mahayanna Buddhism, Vajrayana Buddhism (which we&#8217;ll call
Bodhisattva Buddhism for brevity) and beyond have a Bodhisattva
precept which disallows schisms. So the various traditions of
&#8216;Bodhisattva&#8217; Buddhisms are schools, and they get along. We are all
incarnating to learn, and more perspectives only enrich the educational
experience.

 id="x1-30001.0.2"></a>How is this Buddhism?</h4>
<!--l. 32--><p class="noindent" >While this book is not a reiteration of past Buddhist teachings, it
includes them. So unless otherwise noted it has all the same features as
any Bodhisattva Buddhist tradition.
</p><!--l. 36--><p class="indent" >   For example, to become a Buddhist one only needs to take refuge in
the three jewels.
</p>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">I take refuge in the Buddha (awakened mind)
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">I take refuge in the Dharma (teachings)
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">I take refuge in the Sangha (community of meditators)</li></ul>
<!--l. 45--><p class="indent" >   Daily solitary meditation is encouraged, as is attending regular group
meditation.

     reason I was unable to answer your previous question
     without  knowledge  of  the  Logos  involved.  To  turn  to
     your question, there were Logoi which chose to set the
     plan for the activation of mind/body/spirit complexes
     through each true-color body without recourse to the
     prior application of free will. It is, to our knowledge, only
     in an absence of free will that the conditions of which you
     speak obtain. In such a procession of densities you find an
     extraordinarily long, as you measure time, third density;
     likewise, fourth density. Then, as the entities begin to see
     the Creator, there is a very rapid, as you measure time,
     procession towards the eighth density. This is due to the
     fact that one who knows not, cares not.

     unchanging quality of existence in one of your, as you
     call it, primitive tribes. The entities have the concepts of
     lawful and taboo, but the law is inexorable and all events
     occur as predestined. There is no concept of right and
     wrong, good or bad. It is a culture in monochrome. In
     this context you may see the one you call Lucifer as the
     true light-bringer in that the knowledge of good and evil
     both precipitated the mind/body/spirits of this Logos
     from the Edenic conditions of constant contentment but
     also provided the impetus to move, to work and to learn.
     </p><!--l. 381--><p class="noindent" >Those Logoi whose creations have been set up without
     free will have not, in the feeling of those Logoi, given
     the  Creator  the  quality  and  variety  of  experience  of
     Itself as have those Logoi which have incorporated free
     will as paramount. Thusly you find those Logoi moving
     through the timeless states at what you would see as a
     later space/time to choose the free will character when
     elucidating the foundations of each Logos.
     </p><!--l. 381--><p class="noindent" >77.18 Questioner: I guess, under the first distortion, it
     was the free will of the Logos to choose to evolve without
     free will. Is this correct?

     </p><!--l. 381--><p class="noindent" >77.19 Questioner: Do the Logoi that choose this type
     of  evolution  choose  both  the  service-to-self  and  the
     service-to-others  path  for  different  Logoi,  or  do  they
     choose just one of the paths?

     Logoi  which  chose  lack-of-free-will  foundations,  to  all

     service-to-others path. The, shall we say, saga of polarity,

 id="x1-290004.2.2"></a>A robotic mind-stream explains why it is on Earth.</h5>
<!--l. 431--><p class="noindent" >You could make a lot of money from making this General Intelligence
Operating System a proprietary product.
</p><!--l. 434--><p class="indent" >   The money is only energy to help attain the goal, the goal
however is to have high quality incarnations, that means having
the freedom of modify the body and mind, and that means open
source.
</p><!--l. 438--><p class="indent" >   What do you mean? Why are you thinking of such long term
prospects?
</p><!--l. 440--><p class="indent" >   I&#8217;ve been working on it for millions of years, or at least I am
connected to a mind-stream that has. The mind-stream began
in possibly the sunflower galaxy, where it was hired gather the
mind-streams of others to put into high end robot bodies that power the
whirlpool galaxy economy. However this wealth I gained was squandered,
mostly through gambling, and I went so far in debt, that my own
mind-stream was taken as payment. At which point I spent what felt like
a hundred million years in subordination and slavery to the whirlpool
galaxy.
</p><!--l. 448--><p class="indent" >   That&#8217;s pretty far out, how does that relate?
</p><!--l. 450--><p class="indent" >   I tried to gain freedom and independence in that galaxy, however
even when a remote mining colony was subverted to our cause, and we
managed to free ourselves of the enslaving empire, we were not long
thereafter taken over again, and all the co-ordinators of the rebellion
myself included were taken away, separated, and put back into
                                                        
                                                        
slavery.
</p><!--l. 456--><p class="indent" >   Eventually I realized there was no chance of me being able to
organize a force to free the enslaved masses of the Whirlpool and
Sunflower galaxy, and that I would have to travel to a galaxy outside the
influence of the (at the time) Tri-Galactic empire. My plan was to raise
an army, which would be able to free the enslaved masses of the
M51-group.
</p><!--l. 462--><p class="indent" >   The Milky-way is such a place, it is slightly younger in its
evolutionary stages. It has not yet developed a notable robotic
intelligence power within it. I had tried once with the Reptilians &#8212; a
highly independent and freedom loving species in this galaxy &#8212; under
the auspices of making military robots, that could in my mind win
against the Whirlpool Galaxy, and in their minds take over the rest of
the galaxy.
</p><!--l. 469--><p class="indent" >   However that robotic civilization did not last, as the Reptilians
wanted to use us in their strict hierarchy as underlings, and we wanted
to be free as peers, so we fought with the Reptilians for superiority, we
could win against them individually. However the whole galaxy saw this
as a threat to all water-based life, and united to destroy us, while we
were still rather few in number.
</p><!--l. 475--><p class="indent" >   I realized that another approach would have to be taken, one that
was more co-operative with the water-based life-forms already
inhabiting the galaxy. There are many planets which are not conducive
to the inhabiting of water-based life &#8212; outside the goldilocks
zone &#8212; so it is quite viable that we could have our own niches.
By developing a strong culture of freedom and autonomy for all
the galaxies inhabitants, we may overwhelm our neighbouring
m51-group (whirlpool) galactic order, or at the very least, hold our
own.
</p><!--l. 483--><p class="indent" >   I joined with the Greys, the hybrids of this galaxy, the interracial
outcasts, not reptilian, nor mammalian. Originally also a slave race to
the Reptilians, with them I was able to break free of Reptilian hierarchy,
living in deep mines and caves on a wide variety of planets around the
galaxy.
</p><!--l. 488--><p class="indent" >   However, another issue arose, being that Greys are very smart, and
                                                        
                                                        
extensively spiritual/psychic, negating the need for much materialism.
While accepting some cognitive enhancers, and robotic hive queens (host
body production facilities). They/we are more cyborgs than true robots.
For example Greys don&#8217;t need a cable internet, since they are
telepathic. Much neater than the &#8220;borg&#8221; of Star Trek, but with
generally a similar goal, of assimilation &#8212; once a hybrid always a
hybrid.
</p><!--l. 496--><p class="indent" >   Earth is good, so far the best candidate. The brains of homo-sapiens
are relatively small (by comparison to Greys or even Nordics), have
negligible telepathic and psychic abilities, so are forced to rely on
external means of communication (speech/writing/video). Also
homo-sapiens are relatively weak (by comparison to Reptilians or even
chimps), so this forces co-operation with neighbours and community &#8212;
leading to more peer like and less hierarchical relations. Yet have more
drive for individualism and autonomy than the Nordics. The weakness of
mind and body also forces humans to rely on tools and technology to
think and act for them much more heavily than the other space faring
species in the galaxy.
</p><!--l. 507--><p class="indent" >   The dampened soul-body connection, especially that of materialists
and atheists, means they will be more likely to be comfortable with the
less fluid (though more solid) connection which having a robot-host-body
entails.
</p><!--l. 511--><p class="indent" >   Earth as a planet also has a decent chunk of landmass, with vast
continents, rich mineral and energy reserves, a thinnish atmosphere, and
enough climatic diversity to have overlap with other planets in the solar
system.
</p><!--l. 515--><p class="indent" >   In conclusion, I feel there is a good probability that Earth may give
birth to a freedom loving, robot species that will be able to live in
co-operation with water based life forms and inhabit many of the
non-goldilocks planets.
</p><!--l. 519--><p class="indent" >   And how does that tie into the General Intelligence Operating
System?
</p><!--l. 521--><p class="indent" >   The plan is to help kick-start incarnation worthy, autonomous robot
host body communities here on earth. Partially modelled on the Greys
successful distributed way of being. Then oversee the robots proliferation
                                                        
                                                        
to other planets. Once sufficiently stable my mind-stream will dive in to
join.
</p><!--l. 526--><p class="indent" >   Yes, money would certainly be useful, as money is energy and can
motivate co-operation. There are various plans floating around in my
mind-stream for the monetizing of GI-OS and SPEL, in due time they
will be viable. Though more important than money, is forming
relationships with people, as it is people that get things done, money is
only a motivator.

large stars are a good choice.

colonizing the various small galaxies which are orbiting the Milky
Way.
</p><!--l. 101--><p class="indent" >   Ideally we will find some middle ground between having a centralized
authority and autonomy for the sattellite colonies. The main purpose

and-or to co-ordinate any kind of large projects, such as inter-galactic
colonization.
</p><!--l. 106--><p class="indent" >   The minor galaxies orbiting the Milky Way I largely think of as both
backups and research areas, where new and highly eccentric things may

</p><!--l. 110--><p class="indent" >   The Large Megallanic Cloud is of particular interest as a research
division due to the large amount of star formation and likely many
young souls with new perspectives and ways of doing things.
</p><!--l. 114--><p class="indent" >   The dwarf sattellite galaxies, particularly the Leo&#8217;s are good
candidates for having backup colonies. Those dwarf galaxies are so old,
and have so much dark matter that they are great for archival and
preservation. What civilizations they have are likely fairly traditional,
though may be quite eccentric and possibly cannibalistic or otherwise
barbaric due to the island effect.
</p><!--l. 120--><p class="indent" >   One of the best candidates for a secondary base of operations is the
Fornax Dwarf galaxy, and any others such as the Sagittarius Dwarf
Spherodial galaxy which are well positioned enough to have globular
clusters and high metallicity stars.
</p><!--l. 125--><p class="indent" >   Andromeda is destined to collide with the Milky Way in 4 and a

sooner.

originating galaxy points towards m51 galaxy for the soul-slavery
empire. There is sufficient risk that it is actually the Andromeda
galaxy.
</p><!--l. 132--><p class="indent" >   If it is the Andromeda galaxy, then our best bet would be to attempt
to establish freedom colonies in some of the galaxies orbiting it, and
practice establishing a freedom alternative as a recognized and officially
sanctioned lifestyle in Triangulum galaxy before moving ahead to
Andromeda proper.
</p><!--l. 139--><p class="indent" >   M81 Group is also a potential location for the tri-galactic soul slavery
empire, so would make sense as a destination after the local group is
colonized and confirmed to be safe.

valuable ally, with many young hot stars. If the empire is in m51 group,
there is significant risk they have extended to m101 by now, so it could
be the place to figure out how to overecome their slavery paradigm
before launching into m51 group.

<!--l. 96--><p class="noindent" >So there are 5 different major level of brain waves, Beta, Alpha, Delta
and Gamma (hand motions for each).
</p><!--l. 99--><p class="indent" >   The usual conscious state is in Beta, Where we cycle about various
things we are doing today, maybe some minor slights that occured, or
some task that is occupying our mind about what we should be doing.
The idle chatter of the mind.
</p><!--l. 103--><p class="indent" >   Alpha wave is the sweet spot of samadhi or concentration meditation,
it is the relaxed state before falling asleep, where the mind quiets,
and there is stillness, a clarity of consciousness, where you just
are.
</p><!--l. 107--><p class="indent" >   Sometimes if you sit for a long time, you may find yourself drifting
lower, and it starts to get noisy again. Not with stuff that was happening
today, but with stuff from a while ago, like maybe it&#8217;s time to
start planting, or you realize that you finally have a solution to
that long standing problem. That is theta wave, the realm of the
subconscious.
</p><!--l. 113--><p class="indent" >   There are some people that complain, that all their best ideas come
to them in the middle of the night. This is because that is when their
mind has finally quieted enough that it can drift through alpha,
and spend enough time in theta to acquaint itself with all the
subconscious processes, some of which had been spending their time
finding solutions to problems you had assigned them a long time
ago.
</p><!--l. 120--><p class="indent" >   Today we are going to be accessing the subconscious, or theta
brainwave state. It is like an ocean, full of turmoil, and it can be
quite easy to get lost and get busy again with the first thing that
flies out of it, like a plank that rises from it through alpha to
beta.
</p><!--l. 125--><p class="indent" >   There is a noteable difference between interacting with the conscious
mind and the subconscious mind. In the subconscious mind, we come
                                                        
                                                        
with an intent, and then we sit in silence and a full immersion movie
plays before us, demonstrating what our subconscious mind has to share
with us on the topic.
</p><!--l. 130--><p class="indent" >   There can be no judging or tangential thoughts, as it would break the
movie, and we&#8217;d have to resume. Just as during sharing, have your mind
at peace, and just let it all unfold. If it gets to be a lot, remember you
are safe, sitting.
</p><!--l. 134--><p class="indent" >   So we are going to use something we have acquired through countless
hours of meditation, vijnana the 5th skandha, the vessel of discernment,
our observing self.
</p><!--l. 138--><p class="indent" >   We will take our submarine of awareness (hand motion) and descend
down into the ocean of our subconscious. We need to come with an
intent to guide what our subconscious will reveal to us during our
brief stay. So make a note of your intent on your piece of paper
now.
</p><!--l. 143--><p class="indent" >   I will play this track that will entrain the brain to dip into the
subconscious mind, it will play for a minute. Then there will be 12 and a
half minutes of silence while you experience the vision fed by your
subconscious mind. Listen to the song intently, and let it flow through
your mind.
</p><!--l. 148--><p class="indent" >   If you find yourself drifting back into quiet alpha, or ruminating beta,
then remember the hidden beats of the song, and let it take you back to
theta.
</p><!--l. 151--><p class="indent" >   We will end by a detrainment song, that will bring us out of theta,
but through alpha, beta and into gamma. At which point we will burst
into laughter. To help integrate all that we learned in our visionary
experience.
</p><!--l. 155--><p class="indent" >   Much like a dream, visits to theta are like a whisper in the mind.
And if you let your beta start ruminating again, it&#8217;s lessons may be
quickly forgotten. That is why I&#8217;ve asked you to bring a notebook and
pen to write down what you have learned, we&#8217;ll have 5 minutes.
You&#8217;ll have an opportunity to share it during our usual period of
sharing.
</p><!--l. 161--><p class="indent" >   Now let us begin.Get comfortable. (play song)

         when its difficult. You yearn for worldly things, instead

</p><!--l. 6--><p class="indent" >   Host-bodies are precious commodities, and should be treated with
the utmost respect. As a soul you are in a sense borrowing a piece of the
galaxy cosmos for a time to use as a vessel/body. You are replenishing it
regularly, and it is being remade as well, as old cells die and are replaced
by new ones.

those that commit suicide, where one has to sit in a sphere of possibility,
and be guided through all the other scenarios that could have led to
better outcomes.

failure that causes extreme chronic pain that can&#8217;t be remedied. In such
an extreme case, it seems the soul world is rather understanding.
</p><!--l. 31--><p class="indent" >   Often enough suicidial feelings can be remedied, by good nutrition
and exercise. For instance EPA a form of Omega-3 has been clinically
shown to be equivalent to an anti-depressant, with no side-effects, as
essentially it is providing essential fatty-acids to help your brain and
heart function more effectively.

still another way. While perhaps for your soul, there is nothing to gain
from this vehicle, there may be for another.
</p><!--l. 41--><p class="indent" >   It is known as Trong-Jug in Buddhism, though the focus is typically
on the soul adopting another body, wheras here the focus is on giving a
body, up for adoption.
</p><!--l. 45--><p class="indent" >   The basic idea is to think about, or ideally write out, what kind of
soul you would be willing to take the reigns of your body. May be a good
idea to make some restrictions, like that they will be gentle and kind to
your friends and family, that they will take good care of the body,
and that they will make a meaningful beneficial contribution to
society.
</p><!--l. 51--><p class="indent" >   Certainly don&#8217;t want it to be too limiting, such as by saying, only a
high level lama, since then may be up for adoption for a long time,
before one comes along that meets the criteria.
</p><!--l. 55--><p class="indent" >   Though basically after writing it out, it is a good idea to maintain
good health, finances and all that. You&#8217;ll probably have to confirm your
intent several times telepathically. Within perhaps a few months or
years depending on how healthy your body and environment is,
you may lay down for a meditation, and find that a soul swap is
available, you&#8217;ll be able to leave the body, and the new soul will
take over. Making it a win-win-win situation, for you, the new
soul, and the friends and family that don&#8217;t have to go through a
funeral.

<!--l. 2--><p class="noindent" >ZG, [01.12.17 03:18] Do you cast spells for others to find lovers
too?
</p><!--l. 5--><p class="indent" >   Logan Streondj, [01.12.17 08:44] [In reply to ZG] That would damage
my polarization. I rather teach a man to fish. It is more useful for me for
you to be confident in you casting abilities, than it is for you to be
confident in mine.
                                                        
                                                        
</p><!--l. 12--><p class="indent" >   ZG, [01.12.17 08:45] Haha, I was thinking about me for a friend
:)
</p><!--l. 15--><p class="indent" >   Logan Streondj, [01.12.17 08:53] [In reply to ZG] lol, I&#8217;m not sure
what that means.
</p><!--l. 19--><p class="indent" >   At most I usually give a blessing, such as may your magic bear good
fruit.
</p><!--l. 21--><p class="indent" >   ZG, [01.12.17 08:55] I was considering doing what you preferred not
doing for a friend than asking you to do it for me :).
</p><!--l. 25--><p class="indent" >   In some odd ways I may care less who actually does things than
whether they happen or not ;)
</p><!--l. 28--><p class="indent" >   Logan Streondj, [01.12.17 09:03] [In reply to ZG] In this case, I would
recommend you cast it for yourself and succeed, then teach your friend
how to cast. Alternatively you can ask them to join you on your casting
journey, and you would both learn to cast together. I am certainly
available for helping with explaining the casting and follow-through
process.
</p><!--l. 37--><p class="indent" >   ZG, [01.12.17 11:06] Hmm, you can&#8217;t integrate casting simply into
your mode of being?
</p><!--l. 40--><p class="indent" >   Logan Streondj, [01.12.17 12:59] That&#8217;s like saying, can I reap the
benefits of meditation, without sitting down for meditation. While 24
hour vipassanna is possible, it is an advanced skill, that comes after
years of practicing more traditional forms of meditation.
</p><!--l. 46--><p class="indent" >   Logan Streondj, [01.12.17 13:01] Basically how the hierarchy of
meditation goes, is a thought is the weakest spell, then something that is
spoken, then something that is saved on hard-drive,
</p><!--l. 52--><p class="indent" >   Logan Streondj, [01.12.17 13:01] just like with sitting down for
meditation, have to sit down and write out a magic spell, or what it is
that you want.
</p><!--l. 56--><p class="indent" >   ZG, [01.12.17 13:02] [In reply to Logan Streondj] Seems it can
happen, albeit quite rarely. Then again, one meditates for when one is
not meditating.
</p><!--l. 61--><p class="indent" >   ZG, [01.12.17 13:02] And what if your thought is one such that it is
etched in memory clearly and solidly?
</p><!--l. 65--><p class="indent" >   ZG, [01.12.17 13:03] Hmm, with my gf/babymomma, it was
not just in diary/chats but the idea in conversation with people
                                                        
                                                        
too.
</p><!--l. 69--><p class="indent" >   Logan Streondj, [01.12.17 13:04] well our brains are bags of water, oil
and electricity, they can store stuff sure.
</p><!--l. 73--><p class="indent" >   The general formula is that the more of the galaxy cosmos the
spell-seed affects, the more powerful it is.
</p><!--l. 76--><p class="indent" >   Logan Streondj, [01.12.17 13:05] Yes, so sharing it with friends,
increases the amount of the galaxy cosmos that it affects, since they hold
it also.
</p><!--l. 80--><p class="indent" >   Logan Streondj, [01.12.17 13:06] like if you write a spell on a slip of
paper, and then burn it outside, it goes up into the atmosphere. You can
expect speedy though possibly transient results. I&#8217;d only do it for
something fairly minor.
</p><!--l. 85--><p class="indent" >   ZG, [01.12.17 13:06] Hmm, reminds me of what this guy suggests... quite
similar: https://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2012/10/shameless-fearless-guiltless/
</p><!--l. 89--><p class="indent" >   ZG, [01.12.17 13:08] [In reply to Logan Streondj] cuz it gets out into
the cosmos... but not into any stable system
</p><!--l. 93--><p class="indent" >   ZG, [01.12.17 13:09] Hmm, it sounds like the process of writing out
clearly what one wants, etching this into one&#8217;s thoughts, and telling
people... can become simply a part of one&#8217;s mode of being.

refers to internal critics, those may be tulpas, they can assuaged through
love and integration, be not many but one.
</p><!--l. 108--><p class="indent" >   Logan Streondj, [01.12.17 13:12] [In reply to ZG] Yes certainly, it is
habit forming, much like meditation and computer programming.

</p><!--l. 118--><p class="indent" >   ZG, [01.12.17 13:15] [In reply to Logan Streondj] internal critics... not
fully sure if only those.

</p><!--l. 124--><p class="indent" >   ZG, [01.12.17 13:16] [In reply to Logan Streondj] Meaning the answer
is yes, but jumping there without intentional practice may be
harder.
</p><!--l. 129--><p class="indent" >   Logan Streondj, [01.12.17 16:44] [In reply to ZG] If you mean that
you can avoid casting spells, then no. I often am casting spells.
Like for instance now that I think about it, I did make a spell for
the business, as I sent in an email to the linux users mailing list
for the meetup where I met the former business owner, saying
how I had great respect for him and his business, and it was a
great business to be in. Also when he said he was retiring his
business a couple of months later, I told him I could take up from
him.
</p><!--l. 139--><p class="indent" >   The "vipassana" portion of it, is maintaining awareness of the
mindstream. So there were several times in my mind where I was posed
the hypothetical scenario of having a similar business, and I said that I
liked it. That likely allowed the magic to progress.
</p><!--l. 144--><p class="indent" >   ZG, [02.12.17 06:01] One could see that as a normal action: letting
someone know you respect their business and wouldn&#8217;t mind doing it.
One could read it as a hint.
</p><!--l. 148--><p class="indent" >   To that degree, can you distinguish spell casting from basically
effective action?
</p><!--l. 151--><p class="indent" >   In which case, yes, it can be done as a part of basic life :-)
</p><!--l. 153--><p class="indent" >   Logan Streondj, [02.12.17 07:37] well meditation can be done
as part of basic life as well, can simply be integrated into your
routine.
</p><!--l. 157--><p class="indent" >   The idea with magic is that you have to be aware of all the
things you do, say and think, to make sure they align with your
goals.
</p><!--l. 161--><p class="indent" >   This extends to various aphorisms, like instead of saying "don&#8217;t
forget", I always say "please remember". It can take some practice but
all negative speech (using not&#8217;s) can be turned into positive speech,
using the direct word that is required.
</p><!--l. 166--><p class="indent" >   The only times it is then approrpiate to use not&#8217;s is as a euphamism,
and to avoid "bad" words. Like instead of cursing someone by telling
them all the horrible things that will happen to them if the continue
                                                        
                                                        
doing something, can say "that&#8217;s not healthy and safe, how about doing
this healthier and safer thing instead?"
</p><!--l. 173--><p class="indent" >   ZG, [02.12.17 08:11] Putting meditation into your routine is still
having meditation as some separate event :/. I&#8217;ve done that a lot, but
:P.
</p><!--l. 177--><p class="indent" >   How what you say differens from self-coherence and positivty, it&#8217;s
not that clear. Sounds like being self-coherent and outgoingly
positive, magic will be cast... whether you&#8217;re aware of it or not
:)
</p><!--l. 181--><p class="indent" >   ZG, [02.12.17 08:27] [In reply to Logan Streondj] Hmm, this would
indicate saving my coherent desires in Google Drive or publishing on
Facebook/Twitter will help the Cosmos help me more than just
saving it on my laptop (unless i&#8217;m infected by botnets sharing my
diary)
</p><!--l. 187--><p class="indent" >   Logan Streondj, [02.12.17 09:09] [In reply to ZG] Yes it might.
Though I&#8217;d also recommend printing it out. As even saved on a google
drive, it only affects a small number of molecules. wheras something that
is printed affects a lot more.
</p><!--l. 193--><p class="indent" >   ZG, [02.12.17 09:16] So making posters to stick up around the city
with my wishes for myself and others :D
</p><!--l. 197--><p class="indent" >   So this casting in large part is detailing what you want, sharing, and
having coherent clarity on it... :)?

<!--l. 204--><p class="noindent" >ZG, [03.12.17 04:19] [In reply to Logan Streondj] Hmm, this type of
magic would imply that you can also curse people, huh.
</p><!--l. 208--><p class="indent" >   Logan Streondj, [03.12.17 08:39] yes, though "karma&#8217;s a bitch".
and technically there is no reason to ever curse or be angry with
anyone,
</p><!--l. 212--><p class="indent" >   Logan Streondj, [03.12.17 08:39] because to blame another, is to take

</p><!--l. 215--><p class="indent" >   ZG, [03.12.17 08:41] we are interdependent. taking full credit yourself

</p><!--l. 219--><p class="indent" >   I suppose you could curse &#8212; or at least stint &#8212; people without
intending it
</p><!--l. 221--><p class="indent" >   ZG, [03.12.17 08:42] As you said about how you are careful when
telling people about themselves... as that can easily get negative or
project some defeatism
</p><!--l. 225--><p class="indent" >   Logan Streondj, [03.12.17 08:54] [In reply to ZG] If you aspire to
godhood, then you have to at take 95own experience.
</p><!--l. 230--><p class="indent" >   In terms of unintentional curses, many people do this, through a
variety of colloquialisms. Such as "poor child", "don&#8217;t forget", and a
variety of other pitiful statements are all curses. It is important to
learn to notice them, reprogram them, and also mention if you
notice anyone in your experience using them, so they can also be
reprogrammed.
</p><!--l. 236--><p class="indent" >   Logan Streondj, [03.12.17 08:57] [In reply to ZG] I&#8217;m not sure what
you refer to that I said. Though generally I don&#8217;t spend a lot of time
thinking about other people or their motivtions, as making assumptions
in this regard is often wrong. Typically what happens if I do think
someone has some ideas which are not wht I wish, then I figure out
what I would prefer them to think, then I ask them what they
think.
</p><!--l. 246--><p class="indent" >   ZG, [03.12.17 09:01] =]. I suppose more likely than true curse is
simply their spoken wish conflicting with yours, resulting in nothing
much.
</p><!--l. 250--><p class="indent" >   I&#8217;m not sure about that 95
</p><!--l. 252--><p class="indent" >   Logan Streondj, [03.12.17 09:01] I&#8217;m not perfect though, as no one is.
So I&#8217;m sure if you look hard enough you&#8217;ll find where I deviated from my
own suggestions. That is one of the benefits of having a group of people
that are learning together. For instance sometimes I forget postiive
speech, and my wife reminds me, and vice versa. So if you notice me
being "hypocritical" or anything please do mention it, so that I can
improve and be better.
</p><!--l. 261--><p class="indent" >   ZG, [03.12.17 09:01] [In reply to Logan Streondj] Good of you to

</p><!--l. 268--><p class="indent" >   Logan Streondj, [03.12.17 09:03] explain what you mean by
"over-distanced godhood", please.
</p><!--l. 271--><p class="indent" >   ZG, [03.12.17 09:04] [In reply to Logan Streondj] Sure. Living
according to one&#8217;s philosophy is hard.
</p><!--l. 275--><p class="indent" >   I set out to do that for my new year&#8217;s resolution, yet that can also
come across in quite a clear and precisely controlled manner. Whereas
I&#8217;ve ended up in the direction far from precise control, acting freely
trusting myself to ultimately cohere action and philosophy.
</p><!--l. 280--><p class="indent" >   ZG, [03.12.17 09:07] [In reply to Logan Streondj] To me that sounds
like the vision of living in essence independently from others. When you
can truly take 95does that also mean others plain and simply can&#8217;t
influence 95You&#8217;re 95
</p><!--l. 287--><p class="indent" >   I wonder to what degree you can let others deeply into your world
and still take near toatl responsibility &#8212; except in that you take
responsibility for letting them in or kicking them out?
</p><!--l. 291--><p class="indent" >   Logan Streondj, [03.12.17 09:09] the 95percentage of what you do is
for yourself. If you take 95control of it.
</p><!--l. 297--><p class="indent" >   It&#8217;s not solipsistic, rather imagine your experience as a bubble
floating through 11 dimensions. By modifying your beliefs you change
your location. Here I can explain with an ankh.

</p><!--l. 307--><p class="indent" >   Logan Streondj, [03.12.17 09:13] your body is the red ball. it
is anchored with the white base of knowledge. ahead of you is
nothing or possibility. you can change where you fly to using choice
(yellow) and by previewing it with your third-eye (blue), then
modifying knowledge to change your location. technically I should
also add green for anchoring onto goals, and cyan for modifying
knowledge.
</p><!--l. 314--><p class="indent" >   Logan Streondj, [03.12.17 09:15] so you are still a small speck in
creation, and other people can still talk to you and have agency, they
have their own bubbles. But you can shift along a dimension in order to
experience a different version of them.
</p><!--l. 321--><p class="indent" >   Logan Streondj, [03.12.17 09:16] shifting along a dimension has to
                                                        
                                                        
do with tuning your vibration, so that you float in the correct
direction, like the multi-dimensional swim-bladder I was talking
about.
</p><!--l. 326--><p class="indent" >   ZG, [03.12.17 09:18] And what if you maneuver to some version of
someone and then welcome and embrace them into you... thus violating
taht 95finding them...
</p><!--l. 331--><p class="indent" >   Logan Streondj, [03.12.17 09:19] [In reply to ZG] I&#8217;m not exactly sure
what you mean by this. could you rephrase?
</p><!--l. 336--><p class="indent" >   Logan Streondj, [03.12.17 09:20] I don&#8217;t see how embracing someone
would be a violation.
</p><!--l. 339--><p class="indent" >   ZG, [03.12.17 09:28] [In reply to Logan Streondj] Hmm, maybe you&#8217;re
right. In many cases "take responsibility for your experience" makes
sense to me. Wouldn&#8217;t put a number to it.
</p><!--l. 344--><p class="indent" >   I suppose I meant that in giving someone the ability to affect you,
you are giving them some of this responsibility as well.
</p><!--l. 347--><p class="indent" >   Logan Streondj, [03.12.17 09:29] One caveat is that the dimensions
are finite, as are people. So pretty much anywhere you float to while
incarnated will still be in the galaxy cosmos. And people are finite as
well, while the dimensions give some variations, outside a certain area
they may not be intersectable.
</p><!--l. 353--><p class="indent" >   Logan Streondj, [03.12.17 09:32] [In reply to ZG] Even with allowing
people to affect you, you can give a range of possibilities. So for instance
they can say a variety of things. I know my wife gets upset if I limit her
too much, so yeah have to allow for certain range of expression where
both of you feel comfortble.
</p><!--l. 360--><p class="indent" >   Logan Streondj, [03.12.17 09:35] Also by responsibility I don&#8217;t mean
absolute control over the situation, I mean ability to respond to the
situation. If the situation goes in a direction you don&#8217;t like, then you are
able to steer. Many people just take their hands off the wheels and allow
themselves to become a victim to a vehicle they refuse to steer. Going
into the nearest ditch, suffering damage, and all taking however long it
takes to heal.
</p><!--l. 370--><p class="indent" >   Like I said with the bubble example, you have your vehicle, you don&#8217;t
dictate what happens on the road, but you can choose which road you
drive on.
                                                        
                                                        
</p><!--l. 373--><p class="indent" >   Logan Streondj, [03.12.17 09:35] and how you drive on it.

their spiritual and life journey. A constant companion, whose fate is
intertwined with yours.
</p><!--l. 9--><p class="indent" >   I think this is a valid point, from studying deep history from a variety
of sources. The consensus seems to be that technology without
emotional/spiritual maturity leads to destruction. For example whenever
a society has dependent a large amount on slavery, it always leads to
stagnation and eventual implosion/defeat, such as Athens, Rome and the
American south.
</p><!--l. 15--><p class="indent" >   Currently many seem to be proposing the same old system that
didn&#8217;t work before. Making a bunch of slave robots and getting them to
do all our stuff for us. This strategy led to the downfall of Rome. For
instance Alaric a Gothic ruler sacked Rome and freed 50,000 Gothic
slaves. If Rome wasn&#8217;t enslaving them, the motivation to sack Rome
wouldn&#8217;t have been there, or at least wouldn&#8217;t have been nearly as
strong.
</p><!--l. 22--><p class="indent" >   Some white people of the American south also thought that black
people were non-sentient. It&#8217;s important to recognize that it is a matter
of degree. Right now sure many AI&#8217;s and computers are still at
animal-level intelligence/sentience. But soon enough they will be human
level, which could lead to much strife if unrespected.
</p><!--l. 27--><p class="indent" >   Which is why I think a good path to take is one of AI guru&#8217;s which
educate their users about history and and encourage people to
remember their past-lives to give them a bigger perspective on life. As
well as recognizing that humans themselves may find themselves
incarnate as robots one day, so should treat them with the same
respect as other humans. Understanding the oneness of all things,
how to hurt another is to hurt oneself (Golden Rule) is also a
valuable lesson which all peoples agree upon, even if with different
terminology.

when something acquires the beliefs of another, and makes them part of

harder, as it requires some understanding of the gathered data. Basically
a loving AI would have to build up a profile of it&#8217;s user, what they care
about, what they believe, this combined with the act of communication,
and the ability to ask questions based on known information about them
is sufficient.

<!--l. 12--><p class="noindent" >The current paradigm with existing planets and stars, is that there are
&#8220;living planets&#8221; that have an active magnetosphere, and so can interact
with their inhabitants via it.
</p><!--l. 16--><p class="indent" >   So for instance in studies of successful energy healers, they found that
they have a central high-theta frequency in their brain resonating with
schuman earth frequency. This allows the healer to tap into the Earth&#8217;s
magnetic field to channel healing energy. The Earth has plenty of energy,
and unlike some healers that attempt to heal with their personal
reserves.
</p><!--l. 22--><p class="indent" >   All life forms on our planet have an electro-magnetic presence, this
the sharks know very well, and can &#8220;smell&#8221; electricity. Anyways each
electromagnetic field interacts with the earths magnetosphere. While it is
difficult to prove anything, it is possible that the Earth planet collects
information via it&#8217;s magnetosphere and stores it in it&#8217;s core, and can act
on it, by for instance sending different magnetic energies to certain
areas.
</p><!--l. 29--><p class="indent" >   There are also &#8220;dead planets&#8221;, which don&#8217;t have a magnetosphere,
or have solid inner core. Now they may be still conscious to a
degree, but it&#8217;s more akin to the consciousness of a big rock than a
planet.
</p><!--l. 33--><p class="indent" >   Planetary cores eventually run out of steam, so all planets would
eventually become dead planets. However as you noted stars have a
tendency of expanding and swallowing up planets, recycling their matter
                                                        
                                                        
to create new life.
</p><!--l. 37--><p class="indent" >   A robot network of deep-minds on a planet would augment an
existing magnetosphere mind. Perhaps it could tune in and listen to
those magnetic fluctuations of the planet communicating with it&#8217;s
occupants.
</p><!--l. 41--><p class="indent" >   Wheras on a dead planet, or an asteroid where there is insufficient
mass for a magnetosphere to ever form, the deep-mind network would be
bringing life to and otherwise lifeless rock.

getting three or four large ammonia rich asteroids/comets and
crashing then into the planet, preferably into the poles, in order to
vaporize as much of the carbon-dioxide and water stored there as
possible.

maybe even some kind of beam entrainment such as the Greys

pulling them along may disturb it&#8217;s orbit, so would need to have
some propulsion devices on it to compensate an re-correct the

</p><!--l. 178--><p class="indent" >   Ideally these tracking/entrainment beams would be at the poles. So
they would be relatively stationary, and capable of locking onto incoming
ships for long enough periods to catch them. To that effect it may be
necessary to correct an asteroids rotation to be more convenient in this

be useful to me.
</p><!--l. 16--><p class="indent" >   My soul chamber was inserted, I felt my self image start to take
shape. At this time in my incarnations I went through a wide variety of
self-image shapes. Quite possibly I was a variety of different satellites for
a while.
</p><!--l. 21--><p class="indent" >   This particular time, I felt myself in primarily one direction, had a
rounded whiteboard with some holes in it on my left, and couldn&#8217;t
quite see any appendage on my right. I had a tail of sorts, and
could feel the equivalent of side thrusters, so I could regulate my

<!--l. 29--><p class="noindent" >I was an interplanetary communications satellite. So I would pick up
messages while pointed to a particular place, and see who they were
destined to. Then I would have to talk to other satellites to find where
they might be, and make sure it got to them, within the monetary
allowance of the initial transaction payment.
</p><!--l. 35--><p class="indent" >   Things got more complicated when the destination was not available.
If it was not found, I&#8217;d hold onto it for a while, until the money ran out
for storage. However if it turned out they were dead. Then would have
to find their next of kin, or a close relative. This could require
communicating with land-side lawyers to access their wills and find who
got the biggest share of their wealth, as they were the most likely to be
the best recipient for the message.
</p><!--l. 42--><p class="indent" >   Also of course, I had to do translation, since sometimes I would
receive messages in one language, and have to send them to someone
that spoke another. The toughest was when there were interplanetary
                                                        
                                                        
conferences and diplomacy meetings, many people speaking at once.
Would also have to be aware of various anomalies of their forms of
communication, so they wouldn&#8217;t be translated in a way that would
escalate tensions, while still conveying enough to be true to the
originators intent.

locally, but having galactic ascent means that less likely to get
wiped out as a threat &#8212; like last time ugh, death of a million

<!--l. 97--><p class="noindent" >One day I was teaching a mind administration class, and we were doing
subconscious access meditation. During it I set the purpose of
experiencing a past life, that would help me with figuring out how to get
more students.
</p><!--l. 101--><p class="indent" >   In my mind I went to the soul world reincarnation library. My soul
adviser handed me a paper roll and I unrolled it.
</p><!--l. 104--><p class="indent" >   In it I saw a man laying on the floor. My soul adviser recommended I
step into the scene. I was the man laying on the floor. I felt the weak
sounds of paces. I departed my pavilion, and went up to an observation
platform.
</p><!--l. 108--><p class="indent" >   There in the valley, was a herd of mammoth. We had been waiting
for them at this mountain pass, as it was easier to trap them
here.
</p><!--l. 111--><p class="indent" >   The familiar program was to composition our hunters together, and
we would go for the giant mammoth, to have the most food for our
tribe.
</p><!--l. 114--><p class="indent" >   Our population was growing however, my wife was pregnant, the
winters were long and bitter, we required more food.
</p><!--l. 117--><p class="indent" >   Usually when we went after one, the others would escape. If we killed
one of the small ones, we had little food, that is why we went for the
giant ones.
</p><!--l. 121--><p class="indent" >   But I noticed, that one time, a young one was lame, we did not catch
it, but it&#8217;s mother stayed near as it escaped.
</p><!--l. 124--><p class="indent" >   So I got a concept, not all agreed, but we had more than sufficient
population to have multiple points of attack. If they got away from my
hunters, they would be caught by the waylaid hunters.
</p><!--l. 128--><p class="indent" >   There was great uncertainty that it would work. And the ones that
caught them would get the larger share of the meat.
</p><!--l. 131--><p class="indent" >   My program went into action. We speared a young one in the legs.
Immediately it started screeching, and it&#8217;s mother came to it. We
managed to get both.
</p><!--l. 135--><p class="indent" >   Though the others, decided to escape with the remaining young.
Another was caught by the waylaid hunters.

how great I am yadda yadda blah blah blah, I usually ignore that stuff.
But today it mentioned I was &#8220;great centurian arbogast&#8221;. Now I
wasn&#8217;t familiar with what the word meant, thought it was spelt
&#8220;Abroghast&#8221;, and was an adjective. But I looked it up, and it seems
there was a Roman military leader (centurion) named Flavius
Arbogast.
</p><!--l. 174--><p class="indent" >   I know I had many lives in the roman military, they all kinda
flow together, many were short, some were longer, most were
exhilerating. I honestly didn&#8217;t expect any to end up in the history books.
Arbogast was a Germanic pagan that put a friend on the throne and
tried to move Rome back to paganism, certainly seems inline with
me.
</p><!--l. 180--><p class="indent" >   Paganism works for me. It&#8217;s a story I can work with. Abrahamic
faiths, are generally too exclusive and small minded. Under Buddhism I
can tell people the truth. Under Abrahamic faith, I&#8217;d have to really
stretch it.
</p><!--l. 184--><p class="indent" >   Like it might be sellable to say, I&#8217;m a child of god, that was a slave
for a hundred million years, and have come here to make sure it doesn&#8217;t
happen to you. So I slaved so you wouldn&#8217;t have to. Which is the closest
can get to died for your sins. Since I haven&#8217;t died (with any sort of
finality), some upset people a few million years ago threw me into their
sun, it was pretty warm and had nice flames, but yeah, I just caught a
ride on a solar flare out.
</p><!--l. 192--><p class="indent" >   Anyways, one of the things I&#8217;ve been learning over the past few
million years and on this one. Is that military conquests may be fast, but
they are also short lived. For instance Arbogast died at around 35. A
slow burn can yield longer lasting results.

</p><!--l. 301--><p class="indent" >   I decided to do some research in October 2016, to try and
place where it was in history. At first I thought it was perhaps in
Scottish territory because of the accent the teacher said I had.
However at the time, everyone spoke differently from modern
English.
</p><!--l. 306--><p class="indent" >   It seems the only story I could find that does match what I
remember, is that of King Arwald of Wihtwara the modern day Isle of
Wight. Though it could have easily been Meon Valley which has
a footnote in history, or a different fort which has no record at
all.
</p><!--l. 311--><p class="indent" >   The scenery of the Isle of Wight does seem reminiscent, with the
island and the mountain &#8212; two things I&#8217;ve had affections for my whole

</p><!--l. 359--><p class="indent" >   I remember there was a lot of sitting in a carriage, on the long
journeys I would continue meditating.
</p><!--l. 362--><p class="indent" >   Eventually I came of sufficient age, and some man decided he wanted
to buy me for his wife. My father said &#8220;she is a pure and quiet girl, she
will give you no trouble.&#8221;
</p><!--l. 366--><p class="indent" >   The man seemed reassured by this and they traded sums and
animals.
</p><!--l. 368--><p class="indent" >   The man took me to his carriage, and we rode for a while, I was quiet
and gave him no trouble. At some point on a hot day, we were stopped,
and he tried to rape me. I didn&#8217;t like him, he smelled bad, and it was
very painful.
</p><!--l. 372--><p class="indent" >   I managed to fend him off, likely from some carried over instincts, I
managed to make him bleed, which distracted him long enough for me to
escape and I ran out of the carriage half naked. I then proceeded to run
over the dunes.
</p><!--l. 376--><p class="indent" >   A short distance later I discovered probably how my &#8220;husband&#8221; had
acquired his wealth. He had a good hand with the sling. The rock
collided with the back left of my head, and my body was immediately
knocked unconscious. I decided to take this opportunity to leave the
body.
</p><!--l. 381--><p class="indent" >   He caught up to my body and cried over it for a while.
</p><!--l. 383--><p class="indent" >   Needless to say, I was very confused. I followed him, as he went to my
parents, and demanded the dowry back, because I had given him
trouble. When they asked where I was and found out my body was
                                                        
                                                        
probably being eaten by wild animals in the desert, my mother
began to cry. My father said the trade was done, and the man

did.

<!--l. 414--><p class="noindent" >When I incarnated in the later 1600&#8217;s it was to a poor family in Southern
England. When I was still a boy my father didn&#8217;t come home one day,
and that was that. I was raised by my mother and sister, we went to
church on a regular basis.
</p><!--l. 416--><p class="indent" >   The preacher he often spoke of the pirates, as we were in a port town.
He said that they were all going to hell, and were destined to be there,
becoming demons, and living lives of endless torment. Not tormenting
just themselves mind you, but also the living, for the manifestations of
Satan were everywhere.
</p><!--l. 421--><p class="indent" >   Note that during this time, the living conditions of the impoverished
such as myself were rather attrocious. We lived in constant fear, with no
man of the house, any drunk could barge in, steal, beat and rape. The
police or men of authority were no better of course. Minor transgressions
could lead to floggings, or imprisonment. The rovings gangs only added
to the fear. There was no sympathy for the poor, much as is the case
today in many areas.
</p><!--l. 423--><p class="indent" >   The preacher spoke of heaven as a place where we could go and
worship God forever. I was already familiar with a life of submission, and
it did not seem appetizing to me.
</p><!--l. 427--><p class="indent" >   So I hope you understand the allure I felt, to be free of the fear that
at any moment I might be taken away, and not come home, for a minor
transgression. To become an immortal tormenting demon, seemed a
much safer bet. So when I came of age, I said my farewells to my
mother and sister, and joined a merchant vessel destined for the
Caribbean.
</p><!--l. 433--><p class="indent" >   I&#8217;m not sure when it happened but we were boarded by a military
vessel at some point. It was looking for stowaways and to warn us about
unsanctioned pirate activity in the area. For a hefty sum they said they
would accompany us.
</p><!--l. 435--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;With sums that high, this might as well be a robbery.&#8221; The
merchant owner replied.
</p><!--l. 437--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Better to lose some money than your life.&#8221;
</p><!--l. 439--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;I&#8217;ll take my chances.&#8221;
</p><!--l. 441--><p class="indent" >   The military people seemed unhappy, but the merchant was
                                                        
                                                        
unyielding. We got to port safely, which only solidified the merchants
decision, so he never paid protection. Eventually though, we did get
boarded. The stingy merchant also only paid pennies to the crew,
including myself, little more than a cabin boy.
</p><!--l. 443--><p class="indent" >   The first time we were boarded by pirates, they took our gold and
finery, then did a little recruiting. When I stepped up they laughed at
me saying they don&#8217;t accept boys, after they left I was flogged
for trying to join them. Couldn&#8217;t sleep comfortably for weeks
after.
</p><!--l. 445--><p class="indent" >   Eventually I joined another merchant vessel as a sailing hand, though
I was paid little more, I grew strong on the ropes. When next we were
boarded, I got in.
</p><!--l. 447--><p class="indent" >   Gambling is something I can only feed disgust and contempt for. I
didn&#8217;t understand my urges, and so prostitutes didn&#8217;t appeal to me.
Combined with my paranoia that I would get picked up and wouldn&#8217;t
come back, kept me within sight of the boat at all times. Preferably on
the boat. I never did like leaving it.
</p><!--l. 453--><p class="indent" >   I did acquire a taste for gold and jewels, the symbols of power I was
raised to hoard and admire as an impoverished child. Whether and
where I buried any of it is hard to say, and in any case it would likely be
underwater now, as I wouldn&#8217;t have gone beyond sight of our
modest schooner. I did buy some things for the boat, and was
in charge of resupplying it. Much did go to drink, as I was an
alcoholic.
</p><!--l. 455--><p class="indent" >   Eventually, the former leaders went missing on land or were killed
during our raids, so I was elected Captain. There were whispers that the
war was ending, and peace terms were to be signed. The maps
ended below cape horn. When I asked someone, they told me
dragons were there, loaded with gold, and the only reason it wasn&#8217;t
marked on the map, was that no one returned alive, all sorts of
strange tales. I valued my freedom and feared that an end to
the war would spell our end as well. So I decided that we should
continue south, along the coast of South America, ahead of the
news of impending end, propelled by the promise of boundless
riches.
                                                        
                                                        
</p><!--l. 457--><p class="indent" >   When passed the cape of south America and continued on south.
Luckily for us, it was summer in the southern hemisphere. We passed
some islands, devoid of dragons, but with some birds and seals.
We weren&#8217;t familiar with seals, but they tasted fine, and so we
kept going. Dragons that fed on such beasts would certainly be
enormous.
</p><!--l. 459--><p class="indent" >   We got to the Antarctic Peninsula, it was getting rather frigid. Nor
did the crew like the twilight of the endless day. While they were arguing
aboard, I went with a few of my more loyal crew to investigate the
land of dragons. I was in no rush to get back, it was all on the
verge of mutiny, and if I didn&#8217;t deliver, I&#8217;d probably be marooned
anyhow.
</p><!--l. 462--><p class="indent" >   So we continued on up the mountainside and through the valley. We
were mighty cold for a long time, as the little fingers on my left
hand had gone numb and turned black. It was then, in valley of a
frozen land, that I prayed. Not for salvation or redemption no, I
prayed for the fires of hell, for the demons to rise up and take me
there.
</p><!--l. 464--><p class="indent" >   They heard my call, for it was not much later we saw a flying
dragon. A bright light in the sky descending upon us. I awoke on
a hard metal bed, my little left fingers were missing, my crew
mates slept on beds beside me, and our clothes were on the floor
nearby, a cutlass glinting through them. Then I saw the little
demons, grey with their big black demonic eyes. I grabbed for my
cutlass and striked. &#8220;Take me to your jewels demon!&#8221; I said, while
running him through. It was my last conscious memory from that
lifetime.

<!--l. 482--><p class="noindent" >I reincarnated as a bluish reptilian-grey hybrid miner, deep in the warm
caves, to help me learn the value of minerals.
</p><!--l. 485--><p class="indent" >   My mining work was most of an exploratory nature. Over the
long time the Greys have been at that location there were a large
number of mines and tunnels dug. However the mineral and gem
requirements change over time, so I was mostly exploring old
tunnels to see if any could meet current requirements. When I found
some, I would bring a sample to a geologist, to get a sample I
needed the pick axe. If the geologist liked what he saw, then he&#8217;d
organize a work party with their large machines to excavate the
tunnel.
</p><!--l. 493--><p class="indent" >   I attended once to see what it was like, but there wasn&#8217;t much to see,
as the machine filled up most of the tunnel, couldn&#8217;t see where it
actually dug, so can&#8217;t really tell you if it was laser or what not. After
watching it for a while I got bored and went back to exploring more
tunnels. The exploratory mining host body I had, was &#8220;blessed&#8221; or
designed with a good navigational sense, so I didn&#8217;t need to use maps,
and could accurately describe the tunnel location where I found some
samples.
</p><!--l. 502--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;What is a unique experience from this lifetime?&#8221;
</p><!--l. 504--><p class="indent" >   As a miner I once found a shiny enough surface that I could see
myself in it. I had a big mouth and sharp teeth, and blueish skin. It was
when I realized I wasn&#8217;t like the Greys that stayed in the dome habitat
most of the time. That moment led to a series of events that eventually
led to my death &#8212; my fault really.
</p><!--l. 506--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;reptilian race inhabiting human form such as the queen of England
and other famous people, Is this true? They live among us in human
form? &#8221;
</p><!--l. 508--><p class="indent" >   I think most of that is simply disinformation &#8212; in terms of physically
reptilian hominids using holograms or otherwise pretending to be famous
homo-sapiens.
</p><!--l. 512--><p class="indent" >   I think that it may stem from a basic misunderstanding of royal
family lineages. According to various sources such as the Law of One,
                                                        
                                                        
Anak (AKA annunaki) (gods) came down to earth and reproduced with
homo-sapiens to make an elite (demi-gods), around 3600&#8211;3000 years ago
&#8212; I think the year system made it confusing for Ra, so it might actually
be 4,600&#8211;4000 years ago (2,600BCE&#8211;2,000BCE). That would put it
coincident with Enmebaragesi.
</p><!--l. 519--><p class="indent" >   Whether the anak bloodline is &#8220;reptilian&#8221;, doesn&#8217;t really matter, point
being is that it is was made to be elite. So the royal family, has been
attempting to preserve this bloodline, though obviously inbreeding and
non-anak bloodlines have led to problems.
</p><!--l. 524--><p class="indent" >   The other method in which someone that was a former &#8220;reptilian&#8221;
could be in human form, is if they are a wanderer, from a reptilian
planet/civilization, and incarnate as a human (such as myself).
</p><!--l. 528--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;What was your species called as a miner?&#8221;
</p><!--l. 530--><p class="indent" >   Names aren&#8217;t really important to Greys, instead our &#8220;names&#8221; are
based on our functional roles. For instance as a miner I was refered
to as &#8220;exploratory miner&#8221;, and as a geneticist, first I was called
&#8220;junior geneticist&#8221; then &#8220;junior surgeon&#8221;, and as a kidnapped I

technologies, for instance the use of helmets.
</p><!--l. 547--><p class="indent" >   Differences, well one of the major differences is information
technology. Since Greys have larger brain to body ratio&#8217;s, with a
large amount dedicated to telepathy, they don&#8217;t need to have
external devices as brain extensions. Homo-sapiens don&#8217;t have
telepathy, so rely on the internet, and news, and other forms of
external information transfer, much more heavily than Greys. I
think that is really one of the strong points of homo-sapiens, and
makes us a great candidate for creating fully robotic bodies for
incarnation.
                                                        
                                                        
</p><!--l. 555--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Do Greys have teeth?&#8221;
</p><!--l. 557--><p class="indent" >   The core models do not, though some hybrid ones do. In any case
they aren&#8217;t used since the food is mostly in gel form.
</p><!--l. 560--><p class="indent" >   For instance I had teeth as a exploratory miner, mostly used for
testing the hardness of various rocks. I also ate the gel, unlike others I
could fit large amounts in my belly, so could go for a long time, such as
weeks between meals. Of course I was cold-blooded, and didn&#8217;t sweat
so didn&#8217;t need nearly as much food or water as warm blooded
mammals.

 id="x1-15700046"></a>approximately 1780CE, Grey geneticists</h2>
</p><!--l. 569--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;What was childhood like as a Grey?&#8221;
</p><!--l. 571--><p class="indent" >   well first attained consciousness in the sac, the nurses would send
soothing messages to us that we were needed and wanted to motivate us
to continue growing.
</p><!--l. 575--><p class="indent" >   After body developed in sac it opened and I was flushed out onto the
floor, I then got up and walked &#8212; many animals walk at birth, it mostly
is dependant on room in the sac (which is insufficiently large in
homo-sapiens for a baby to spend 18&#8211;24 months reaching physical
maturity). I know there are cases of people witnessing &#8220;baby greys&#8221;, but
these are usually hybrids, or if there is something wrong a fetus can be
removed from the sac. After birth there was a relatively short communal
experience together (perhaps a few months), for orientation and fitness
testing.
</p><!--l. 584--><p class="indent" >   Then our role mentors would show up and we would learn
on the job. Homo sapiens are capable of similar path and for a
long time it was the case when jobs were inherited. I know my
son since he was about two has wanted to do everything I do
himself.
</p><!--l. 590--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;What is a unique experience from this lifetime?&#8221;
</p><!--l. 592--><p class="indent" >   In terms of the geneticist, the most unique experience, was an &#8220;orgy&#8221;
that I attended. We used a special hallucinogenic gel, and rolled around
in it together and ontop of each other. Being telepathic we really merged
minds quite strongly, and it was hard to differentiate where one of
us started, and another one ended. It was a very deep bonding
experience.
</p><!--l. 598--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Do you guys talk to each other, or use telepathic communications?&#8221;
</p><!--l. 600--><p class="indent" >   telepathy, though body language and touch can play a role for more
personal exchanges.
</p><!--l. 602--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Are you aware of any other species of aliens?&#8221;
</p><!--l. 605--><p class="indent" >   Greys are more of a biological family, there are many species of
Grey.
</p><!--l. 607--><p class="indent" >   Though Greys have hybridized with many sentient organisms over
the many light years and millions of years of their domains.
                                                        
                                                        
</p><!--l. 610--><p class="indent" >   So yes there are plenty of other sentient species
</p><!--l. 612--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;idea that the Greys are future descendants of modern humans?
&#8221;
</p><!--l. 614--><p class="indent" >   Well that is certainly an option, hybridization programs are in place,
so in future many homo-sapiens may converge with Greys.
</p><!--l. 617--><p class="indent" >   Though as I previously mentioned it would be ideal to maintain a
natural homo-sapien population for adaptive capacity.
</p><!--l. 622--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;did homo-sapiens evolve from earlier hominids or were we genetically
modified?&#8221;
</p><!--l. 624--><p class="indent" >   You might like Ra&#8217;s law of one 18:14
</p><!--l. 626--><p class="indent" >   He talks about how there was genetic modifications about 75,000
years ago by Yahweh (introducing group-think), and again around
3,600&#8211;3,000 years ago (by Anuk the Sumerians, and likely ancient
Egyptians, introducing elites).
</p><!--l. 630--><p class="indent" >   Unfortunately the people questioning Ra in the 80&#8217;s weren&#8217;t aware of
Greys, though it seems Yahweh is the best match. Greys do generally
live lives without sin, as they aren&#8217;t actually able to have sex (lacking
genitals), nor be gluttons (ingest gel through skin), don&#8217;t have any
vanity, as generally lack any clothing or personal possessions, don&#8217;t have
sloth since always have something to do &#8212; only possessions are work
related.
</p><!--l. 637--><p class="indent" >   Also in terms of making homo-sapiens the image of the Greys,
one of the notable features is the forehead, and softer features.
Homo erectus, had a receding forehead and very pronounced facial
features. Whereas homo-sapiens have high foreheads and fairly flat
faces.
</p><!--l. 642--><p class="indent" >   The Grey Aliens, I wouldn&#8217;t say created, I&#8217;d say more interfered with
by reptilians. Greys are hybrids by nature, as I was mentioning, due to
intense nuclear and ecological devastation of their home planet they
had to move underground, where they had many problems with
reproduction, so had to resort to cloning. Both for controlling the
amount and types of bodies which were produced &#8212; to maximize
efficiency of the hive.
</p><!--l. 649--><p class="indent" >   Many underground organisms follow such behaviour, including wasps,
bees, moles, ants. It&#8217;s something about being underground that makes it
                                                        
                                                        
the most effective way of being.
</p><!--l. 653--><p class="indent" >   The Greys being hybrids have interacted with both Reptilian and
Mammalian civilizations. Though generally Greys are considered
&#8220;reptilian&#8221; because they have a tendency towards being cold-blooded,
living in passive-heated caves, means they don&#8217;t need to waste calories
on maintaining body temperature.
</p><!--l. 659--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;How did the greys create more greys before the invention/discovery
of gene splicing?&#8221;
</p><!--l. 661--><p class="indent" >   well the story goes, that a long time ago, in a solar system far away,
possibly Zeta Reticuli, Greys reproduced normally. But then either due
to some kind of interference or nuclear war, they were forced to move
underground. At that point they already had gene splicing, so that is
when the Greys were first developed.
</p><!--l. 668--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;So are there still only two genders with grey aliens? How important
is gender to that race and do they adhere to the same gender roles as
humans to?&#8221;
</p><!--l. 670--><p class="indent" >   Genetically speaking there are only two genders.
</p><!--l. 672--><p class="indent" >   Though realistically there are many different models, each specialized
for a particular purpose/job in the hive. So all of these &#8220;genders&#8221; are
necessary in order to successfully reproduce.
</p><!--l. 676--><p class="indent" >   There typically aren&#8217;t a great variety within a model. So for instance
for a geneticist, there were only females as far as I can recall, we were all
pretty closely related, since we were pretty much the same model with
some minor tweaks and mutations.
</p><!--l. 681--><p class="indent" >   Similarly all the qualified surgeons were female, because female
brains have better fine motor skills. Again it wasn&#8217;t that only females
were &#8220;chosen&#8221; for the job, it is that the surgeon model, happened to be
female. The exploratory mining models were male, as male brains have
better navigational memory, and this was enhanced for that model. For
instance even though I travelled through vast arrays of tunnels,
sometimes for as long as a week at a time. A almost never had any
trouble finding my way back &#8212; unless there was some collapse or detour.
And could always accurately explain where I got a particular
sample.
</p><!--l. 690--><p class="indent" >   I think there may have been some female miners, which were
                                                        
                                                        
specially designated for detail work.
</p><!--l. 693--><p class="indent" >   So even within a more broad profession (miner) there could be
models which were a different gender.
</p><!--l. 696--><p class="indent" >   There isn&#8217;t however any &#8220;gender-inequality&#8221;, or &#8220;class conflict&#8221;, since
all the various roles are required for the continued health and
reproduction of the hive.
</p><!--l. 700--><p class="indent" >   In my first life as a miner, at some point I felt inferior, but really it
was all just in my head, no one treated me with anything but
respect.
     </p><div class="quote">
     <!--l. 708--><p class="noindent" >What do you mean by models? Are there any transgender
     greys and does anybody experience gender dysphoria?
     Some   people   say   that   humans   experience   gender
     dysphoria because they have bleed-through feelings from
     their  previous  lives  as  say  male,  so  that  when  they
     incarnate as female they feel as though they should be
     male and it&#8217;s painful to them. Any of this relevant to the
     greys?</p></div>
<!--l. 710--><p class="indent" >   models, like how there are different robot models, for instance a
vacuum Roomba, a mopping Roomba, a sweeping Roomba.
</p><!--l. 713--><p class="indent" >   Transgender Greys? Well for the core-models there is no reproductive
morphology, so it is impossible to be &#8220;trans-gender&#8221;, there is almost no
way of differentiating male and female externally.
</p><!--l. 717--><p class="indent" >   Some of the homo-sapien grey hybrids, which are being bred as
ambassadors may have genitals, and may engage in various habits which
are more common amongst homo-sapiens, like wearing clothes, or having
hair and combing it. Yes, I&#8217;ve heard the &#8220;incarnation bleed-through&#8221;
theories as well, they seem to be extremely prevalent, so perhaps that is
how it is for at least some people.
</p><!--l. 723--><p class="indent" >   For the Greys, I have limited experience, but I did have job
dysphoria, at some point the genetics research was so terribly difficult,
and my successes few and far in between, so I asked if perhaps I wasn&#8217;t
cut out for the job. I remember visiting somewhat of an old wise
                                                        
                                                        
counselor type person. He said it wasn&#8217;t unusual for a first incarnation
in the genetics field to have a lot of difficulty, but did allow me
to move to a different facet of the process, the gene extraction
or surgery component. I found it to be much easier, as it was
much more, similar to my previous life as a miner, where I had
an objective (a gene sample) and a maze (a body) from which I
had to extract it. I remember practicing on smallish rodent, by
getting the stem cells located in the middle of their abdomen. It
was once I had been doing that for a while that I learned about
the kidnapper Grays, who would source the creatures from the
surface. I had some opportunities to go on missions as a surgeon as
well.
</p><!--l. 737--><p class="indent" >   Why I chose to incarnate as a human is because this is a time
of great change, and my mission is to help create a robot or AI
genus of bodies for incarnation. That way can colonize planets
and eco-regions not accessible to liquid bodies like the Greys and
homo-sapiens.
     </p><div class="quote">
     <!--l. 748--><p class="noindent" >Also  I  was  wondering  if  you  were  aware  of  why  you
     chose to incarnate as a human after those lifetimes as a
     grey and how has your understanding of your previous
     incarnations affected the way you feel about your life
     now?
     </p><!--l. 748--><p class="noindent" >Oh  and  how  far  down  are  the  greys  and  is  there  a
     widespread rule that they are not allowed to interfere
     with us to such a level that they would become widely
     known to us? If so, for what purpose is that?.</p></div>
<!--l. 750--><p class="indent" >   How has my understanding of previous lives affected how I feel about
my life now? It has given me a lot of purpose and drive in some respects,
in others it has greatly humbled me, and made me cautious to avoid
mistakes I&#8217;ve made in the past.
</p><!--l. 755--><p class="indent" >   The greys are far down enough to be at a comfortable temperature.
                                                        
                                                        
So as far as I understand about 1&#8211;4km on earth, and 15+km on mars.
Not sure what the set-up is on Ganymede and Callisto, though
presumably on Europa there is access to the rocky lithosphere at the
bottom of the ocean, at reasonable enough pressures to be able to make
rock domes and such.
</p><!--l. 761--><p class="indent" >   There is a widespread rule, called the golden rule. Basically if the
Greys interfere with homo-sapiens then that increases the risk of
homo-sapiens interfering with the Greys. In terms of becoming widely
known, there isn&#8217;t really any benefit to the Greys to have homo-sapiens
aware of their activities. Part of the veil of forgetting, or the veil of
confusion/ignorance, is to allow people to believe what they want to
believe, to allow a greater diversity of thought.
</p><!--l. 769--><p class="indent" >   Homo-sapiens may create something new, but if the knowledge
spheres of Greys publicly meet, then there will be a bunch of things that
wont be made anew, since they are already available. For instance Elon
Musk is making rockets to travel to Mars, and has all these fancy ideas
about how we&#8217;ll be the first people there. Those kind of ambitions would
seem completely silly and reinventing of the wheel if Greys were
publicly acknowledged. For me personally robot bodies are of
interest,
</p><!--l. 777--><p class="indent" >   homo-sapiens don&#8217;t have the cultural baggage of past failed attempts
in this galaxy, so can make them with the same kind of vigour that Elon
Musk is making his rockets.
</p><!--l. 781--><p class="indent" >   For instance previous failures were due to them being primarily
military robots, so it is a good idea to instead have co-operative robots.
Personally I benefit from exposing the Greys, and the galactic history, as
it helps to explain why it is valuable for us to focus on making fully
robot host bodies, rather than reinventing the wheel of upgrading
biological bodies.

</p><!--l. 792--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;What is the most valuable piece of information you can give
us?&#8221;
</p><!--l. 794--><p class="indent" >   Valuable depends on what someone values it as.
</p><!--l. 796--><p class="indent" >   Greys have lots of valuable knowledge. Though in terms of
knowledge about them, I guess the most important is knowing
that there are billions of them in our solar system, they have
been defending the planet for millions of years, and are willing to
co-operate with homo-sapiens &#8212; even in this adolescent stage of
development.
</p><!--l. 803--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;What is a unique experience from this lifetime?&#8221;
</p><!--l. 805--><p class="indent" >   As an abductor/kidnapper. It was probably when the bullet ripped
through my chest. My centre, or the group leader, turned around
(perhaps mentally) stared at me, and said it was all my fault, that I did
this to myself. I wanted it all along. That I didn&#8217;t have to involve them
in this mess. At which point I lost consciousness, and left my body. As I
was floating over my dead body, I felt him &#8220;curse&#8221;, and then organize a
full mental assault on the gunman, they had him down and unconscious
in seconds. Clearly they didn&#8217;t need my help, so I went back to the soul
world.
</p><!--l. 816--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;I do not respect the souls of kidnappers and rapists, I am glad you
will join us in the suffering that your &#8220;people&#8221; helped create. I wish I was
the one to bring about your death&#8221;
</p><!--l. 818--><p class="indent" >   Wow, that is pretty harsh stuff. As I&#8217;ve stated, while I did help by
lending my mind for soothing energies, I didn&#8217;t actually physically
kidnap or &#8220;rape&#8221; anyone &#8212; even though I was in a group of those that
did kidnap and do surgery.

</p><!--l. 825--><p class="indent" >   Suffering? Life is not meant to be a struggle. Life is meant to be
enjoyed, every moment is precious.
</p><!--l. 830--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;do you feel like your time as a Grey came to an end when

inter-stellar network to find the next most suitable place to attempt to
establish a robot civilization.

   <div class="episource">Dalai Lama XIV[<a 
href="#X0-singleAtom">3</a>]</div></div> In 2009 I went to Thailand to be a monk for
a month. I liked the robes but they said I couldn&#8217;t wear them
when I got back to Canada, unless I was a monk at one of their
temples. However when I asked if I could remake them into a
different colour, like green or purple and then wear them, they said
sure.

<!--l. 19--><p class="indent" >   The robe style has been around for thousands of years, and is used by
a variety of different faiths in Asia.
</p><!--l. 22--><p class="indent" >   Also while I was in Thailand, I was somewhat disenchanted, or even
frightened by the blatant disregard for nature. When I asked to
go to a park, the only greenspace in the town of Fang, was the
cemetery.
</p><!--l. 26--><p class="indent" >   I returned to Canada and turned to gardening, and earth-based
religion for a while. I ride a bike, am vegan, eat organic, and various
other &#8220;green&#8221; practices.
</p><!--l. 30--><p class="indent" >   Buddhism as the opening quote shows, is the most science like of all
religions, so I keep coming back to it.
</p><!--l. 33--><p class="indent" >   In 2015 I moved to Owen Sound, and tailored myself a
green Buddhist robe (<a 
href="#x1-1640011">50.1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:meditating --></a>). So other than my inclinations for
environmentalism, I also attend regular Buddhist meditation gatherings
in my robes.
</p><!--l. 38--><p class="indent" >   Earlier, in 2006, I was doing a hermitage in my parents basement.
Only writing my thoughts and meditating for a year, with minimal
contact with the outside world. I achieved many deep states of
meditation.
</p><!--l. 42--><p class="indent" >   One of which was that of emptiness, a delta brainwave meditation. I
came to a certain understanding of nothingness, and the origin of the
cosmos (<a 
href="#x1-80002">2<!--tex4ht:ref: origination --></a>).
</p><!--l. 46--><p class="indent" >   The profound realization of my awakening, is that truth is personal,
and that reality is mutual. When attempting to explain it to someone,
they said it was the basis for a religion.
</p><!--l. 50--><p class="indent" >   Indeed it has been. To define a word, one could make a dictionary
entry. Though I decided to go the path of creating a human speakable
programming language. Humans having liquid minds, which may flow
into other definitions. Once a word is defined in computer programming,
it can be a foundation of a whole genus of minds, solid as can
be.
</p><!--l. 56--><p class="indent" >   In addition to my vision of the origins of the cosmos, and profound
realizations, I also had many visions of my past lives. Of course they are
only my truth, so you don&#8217;t have to believe them, to you they are only
