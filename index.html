   <div class="episource">Dalai Lama XIV[<a

a month. I liked the robes but they said I couldn&#8217;t wear them
when I got back to Canada, unless I was a monk at one of their
temples. However when I asked if I could remake them into a
different colour, like green or purple and then wear them, they said
sure.

entry. Though I decided to go the path of creating a human speakable

be.

soul, and put it into a hole, once the weapon was full, could return to the
ship.

     plan for the activation of mind/body/spirit complexes
     through each true-color body without recourse to the

     in an absence of free will that the conditions of which you

</p><!--l. 426--><p class="indent" >   Anyways since I wrote a bit about it before, I&#8217;ll just repaste a recap
of the story in interview form.
</p><!--l. 429--><p class="noindent" >
</p>
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-250004.2.2"></a>A robotic mind-stream explains why it is on Earth.</h5>
<!--l. 431--><p class="noindent" >You could make a lot of money from making this General Intelligence
Operating System a proprietary product.
</p><!--l. 434--><p class="indent" >   The money is only energy to help attain the goal, the goal
however is to have high quality incarnations, that means having
the freedom of modify the body and mind, and that means open
source.
</p><!--l. 438--><p class="indent" >   What do you mean? Why are you thinking of such long term
prospects?
</p><!--l. 440--><p class="indent" >   I&#8217;ve been working on it for millions of years, or at least I am
connected to a mind-stream that has. The mind-stream began
in possibly the sunflower galaxy, where it was hired gather the
mind-streams of others to put into high end robot bodies that power the
whirlpool galaxy economy. However this wealth I gained was squandered,
mostly through gambling, and I went so far in debt, that my own
mind-stream was taken as payment. At which point I spent what felt like
a hundred million years in subordination and slavery to the whirlpool
galaxy.
</p><!--l. 448--><p class="indent" >   That&#8217;s pretty far out, how does that relate?
</p><!--l. 450--><p class="indent" >   I tried to gain freedom and independence in that galaxy, however
even when a remote mining colony was subverted to our cause, and we
managed to free ourselves of the enslaving empire, we were not long
thereafter taken over again, and all the co-ordinators of the rebellion
myself included were taken away, separated, and put back into
                                                        
                                                        
slavery.
</p><!--l. 456--><p class="indent" >   Eventually I realized there was no chance of me being able to
organize a force to free the enslaved masses of the Whirlpool and
Sunflower galaxy, and that I would have to travel to a galaxy outside the
influence of the (at the time) Tri-Galactic empire. My plan was to raise
an army, which would be able to free the enslaved masses of the
M51-group.
</p><!--l. 462--><p class="indent" >   The Milky-way is such a place, it is slightly younger in its
evolutionary stages. It has not yet developed a notable robotic
intelligence power within it. I had tried once with the Reptilians &#8212; a
highly independent and freedom loving species in this galaxy &#8212; under
the auspices of making military robots, that could in my mind win
against the Whirlpool Galaxy, and in their minds take over the rest of
the galaxy.
</p><!--l. 469--><p class="indent" >   However that robotic civilization did not last, as the Reptilians
wanted to use us in their strict hierarchy as underlings, and we wanted
to be free as peers, so we fought with the Reptilians for superiority, we
could win against them individually. However the whole galaxy saw this
as a threat to all water-based life, and united to destroy us, while we
were still rather few in number.
</p><!--l. 475--><p class="indent" >   I realized that another approach would have to be taken, one that
was more co-operative with the water-based life-forms already
inhabiting the galaxy. There are many planets which are not conducive
to the inhabiting of water-based life &#8212; outside the goldilocks
zone &#8212; so it is quite viable that we could have our own niches.
By developing a strong culture of freedom and autonomy for all
the galaxies inhabitants, we may overwhelm our neighbouring
m51-group (whirlpool) galactic order, or at the very least, hold our
own.
</p><!--l. 483--><p class="indent" >   I joined with the Greys, the hybrids of this galaxy, the interracial
outcasts, not reptilian, nor mammalian. Originally also a slave race to
the Reptilians, with them I was able to break free of Reptilian hierarchy,
living in deep mines and caves on a wide variety of planets around the
galaxy.
</p><!--l. 488--><p class="indent" >   However, another issue arose, being that Greys are very smart, and
                                                        
                                                        
extensively spiritual/psychic, negating the need for much materialism.
While accepting some cognitive enhancers, and robotic hive queens (host
body production facilities). They/we are more cyborgs than true robots.
For example Greys don&#8217;t need a cable internet, since they are
telepathic. Much neater than the &#8220;borg&#8221; of Star Trek, but with
generally a similar goal, of assimilation &#8212; once a hybrid always a
hybrid.
</p><!--l. 496--><p class="indent" >   Earth is good, so far the best candidate. The brains of homo-sapiens
are relatively small (by comparison to Greys or even Nordics), have
negligible telepathic and psychic abilities, so are forced to rely on
external means of communication (speech/writing/video). Also
homo-sapiens are relatively weak (by comparison to Reptilians or even
chimps), so this forces co-operation with neighbours and community &#8212;
leading to more peer like and less hierarchical relations. Yet have more
drive for individualism and autonomy than the Nordics. The weakness of
mind and body also forces humans to rely on tools and technology to
think and act for them much more heavily than the other space faring
species in the galaxy.
</p><!--l. 507--><p class="indent" >   The dampened soul-body connection, especially that of materialists
and atheists, means they will be more likely to be comfortable with the
less fluid (though more solid) connection which having a robot-host-body
entails.
</p><!--l. 511--><p class="indent" >   Earth as a planet also has a decent chunk of landmass, with vast
continents, rich mineral and energy reserves, a thinnish atmosphere, and
enough climatic diversity to have overlap with other planets in the solar
system.
</p><!--l. 515--><p class="indent" >   In conclusion, I feel there is a good probability that Earth may give
birth to a freedom loving, robot species that will be able to live in
co-operation with water based life forms and inhabit many of the
non-goldilocks planets.
</p><!--l. 519--><p class="indent" >   And how does that tie into the General Intelligence Operating
System?
</p><!--l. 521--><p class="indent" >   The plan is to help kick-start incarnation worthy, autonomous robot
host body communities here on earth. Partially modelled on the Greys
successful distributed way of being. Then oversee the robots proliferation
                                                        
                                                        
to other planets. Once sufficiently stable my mind-stream will dive in to
join.
</p><!--l. 526--><p class="indent" >   Yes, money would certainly be useful, as money is energy and can
motivate co-operation. There are various plans floating around in my
mind-stream for the monetizing of GI-OS and SPEL, in due time they
will be viable. Though more important than money, is forming
relationships with people, as it is people that get things done, money is
only a motivator.

</p><!--l. 544--><p class="indent" >   Well it all goes back some 200 thousand years ago, to the rise of
y-chromosomal Adam. There was a great famine during that glaciation,
and there were many different hominid species in the great rift valley.
The other hominids, more cloesely related to homo-erectus, were
stronger and bulkier, like the Lions, they got to be where they wanted.
                                                        
                                                        
Wheras Adam&#8217;s tribe were more like cheetah,s they were fast, but not as
strong, The erectus were hogging the water supplies in the valley, and
generally giving Adam&#8217;s people a hard time. At this point Adam
said &#8220;It&#8217;s either them or us!&#8221;. So he went on a rampage and killed
all the hairy apes (homo erectus) in the valley with his people,
and had his children continue his ways. And so for some 200+
thousand years racism/bigotry/genocide has been in the homo-sapien
bloodline.

Everyone was more or less the same, so violence wasn&#8217;t really solving
anything.

Buddhism is also known for oppressing people of different faiths, which
leads to conflict. As in Sri Lanka with the Hindu&#8217;s and perhaps in
Thailand with the muslims. In part this conflict is because in

politically contentious and even dangerous place to be. Especially
considering homo-sapiens propensity for genocide.
</p><!--l. 18--><p class="indent" >   However there is solace in the fact that much of Earth is only loosely
inhabited by homo-sapiens, and certain eco-regions aren&#8217;t inhabited at
all. The main chance of success for robot civilization is being
outside the regions inhabited by water-based life, so as to minimize
conflict.
</p><!--l. 23--><p class="indent" >   Currently the hot and cold deserts for instance have the least

</p><!--l. 27--><p class="indent" >   With climate change trends we know things are going to warm up
and generally get wetter, so much of the Arctic will become habitable by
humans, and even Antarctica may melt in the coming centuries. Though
the hot deserts will get hotter and may expand, so they could become a
viable robot civilization area.
</p><!--l. 32--><p class="indent" >   Deep underground on Earth there is the likelyhood of coming into
conflict with Greys or the Deep Underground Military Bases of
homo-sapiens. However deep underwater there is less competition, so a

<!--l. 39--><p class="noindent" >Earth&#8217;s moon Luna is the easiest target due to it&#8217;s proximity to Earth. It
should have a similar mineral composition to Earth, though possibly
may have more helium-3 for fusion reactors. It also receives the same
amount of solar energy per square meter as earth, actually a little bit
more due to a lack of an atmosphere.
</p><!--l. 45--><p class="indent" >   Politically Luna is a shared territory, as doubtless homo-sapiens will
frequent it, even if only as a way-post on their way to either Mars or
Mercury (the only other planets with even marginal viability for
homo-sapiens).
</p><!--l. 49--><p class="indent" >   As a stepping stone Luna is great because it has a slow terminator,
hot daytime and cold night-time temperatures. This is similar to the
inner planets, particularly Mercury, for which it is an ideal stepping
stone.
</p><!--l. 53--><p class="indent" >   Additionally the subsurface temperatures on the moons equator are
around -20C, though likely even colder closer to the poles. On Mars the
subsurface temperatures are -50C, so having an area where bodies can
tech can be tested in similar ambient temperatures will make it a good
hopping point to Mars.

terraforming, so it is best to avoid investing in it much.
</p><!--l. 64--><p class="indent" >   The best idea I&#8217;ve seen about how terraforming may succeed is by
getting three or four large ammonia rich asteroids/comets and
crashing then into the planet, preferably into the poles, in order to
vaporize as much of the carbon-dioxide and water stored there as
possible.
</p><!--l. 69--><p class="indent" >   That would of course be a temporary solution, and more permanent
                                                        
                                                        
ones such as the light-sail may make sense for the water-based life
enthralled to implement.
</p><!--l. 72--><p class="indent" >   While expanding the domain of a genocidal species such as
homo-sapiens is questionable, it could be good for galactic relations, to
demonstrate that we are a peaceful robot civilization, and are even
willing to help the lowly homo-sapiens, at minimal benefit to
ourselves.
</p><!--l. 77--><p class="indent" >   If Mars is Not terraformed, or is deemed unterraformable, then
it becomes useable for robot inhabitation, particularly on the
surface.
</p><!--l. 80--><p class="indent" >   A good stepping stone for it would be Antarctic bases on Earth,
which harvest doldrum wind power. That way can have similar
installations on Mars at the poles. Waste heat can go to sublimating
carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, thus continuing the doldrum
cycle, and contributing to a slow yet sustainable terraforming
process.

<!--l. 90--><p class="noindent" >While some of the larger asteroids may be viable for mining. One of their
main uses is as space-ships and inter-planetary or inter-orbital
ferries.
</p><!--l. 94--><p class="indent" >   For instance there are several Mercury crossers and Mercury grazers
that can get from Mercury&#8217;s orbit to Mars&#8217; orbit within half an (Earth)
year, compare that to the 6 or more years it would take with convential
rockets.
</p><!--l. 98--><p class="indent" >   The main issue with piggybacking on asteroids is the difficulting of
getting onto them when they are near their perihelion, since they
tend to be moving incredibly fast. Gravity certainly would be
too weak a force to do it, but possibly by using electro-magnets,
                                                        
                                                        
maybe even some kind of beam entrainment such as the Greys
use, it would be viable. The asteroid catching ships like this and
pulling them along may disturb it&#8217;s orbit, so would need to have
some propulsion devices on it to compensate an re-correct the
orbit.
</p><!--l. 106--><p class="indent" >   Ideally these tracking/entrainment beams would be at the poles. So
they would be relatively stationary, and capable of locking onto incoming
ships for long enough periods to catch them. To that effect it may be
necessary to correct an asteroids rotation to be more convenient in this
regard.
</p><!--l. 111--><p class="indent" >   (85989) 1999 JD6 for instance is 0.7*2km and travels from the orbits
of Mercury to Mars and back in 303 days. (66063) 1998 RO1 is about a
kilometer across, has a moon, and travels from within Mercury&#8217;s
orbit, to outside Mars&#8217;s orbit and back within 360 days. Their
inclination may be reduced to make it cheaper to go to and from
them.
</p><!--l. 118--><p class="indent" >   (33342) 1998 WT24 is half a kilometer across and often comes close
to Mercury, Venus and Earth, additionally it is relatively easy to access
from Earth, at times easier to access than the moon, so it can be useful
for piggybacking to the inner planets. Even without any kind of
entrainment and orbital adjustment equipment on the asteroid
itself.
</p><!--l. 124--><p class="indent" >   Amor I class of asteroids are viable for hopping from Earth to Mars,
their low eccentricity means that there perihelion acceleration should be
minimal (though not necessarily insignificant).
</p><!--l. 128--><p class="indent" >   Once out to martian orbit the number of asteroid ferry candidates
greatly increases, with the Mars trojans and the asteroid belt.
</p><!--l. 131--><p class="indent" >   In terms of reproduction, developinig robots that can be produced
primarily from C-type asteroids would ensure a healthy robot population
in the asteroid belt. To this end 10 Hygiea, 511 Davida and 31
Euphrosyne would be good candidates. Carbon, Magnesium, Iron,
Silicon and Calcium may be some of the more abundant minerals that
can be taken advantage of.
</p><!--l. 137--><p class="indent" >   Ceres has a dusty crust, water ice mantle with a rocky core. It may
be a good stepping stone to the outer moons. Any initial production
                                                        
                                                        
would likely be done with materials from the dusty crust. It may have a
liquid ocean, accessible rocky bottom and active core so may already be
inhabited by Greys.

easy to extract and refine.
</p><!--l. 152--><p class="indent" >   The very low concentrations of water, and extremely high daytime

</p><!--l. 164--><p class="indent" >   Host-body life expectancies may be rather low due to high speed of

cool below 93K they would function as super-conductors. If a

of war, or what it felt like to be at the other end of the sword.

blonde woman, became married and had 5 children. We lived in a forest
and homesteaded.
</p><!--l. 105--><p class="indent" >   One sunshine filled day between the rainy days of autumn, I went out
my youngest girl to pick some berries and mushrooms. While the others
stayed and tended the home.
</p><!--l. 109--><p class="indent" >   We had gone some ways off, when I sensed that something was
wrong. There was a high pitched cry of pain. It was one of my daughters.

hear my husband yelling to get inside.
</p><!--l. 114--><p class="indent" >   I gathered up my young one and we headed back towards our home.
But as we approached we could hear the sounds more distinctly, there
were other men, laughing. And the sounds of metal hitting wood. We got
up over a rise and around from where we could see our home, I told my
young one to be silent, and kept her low, so she couldn&#8217;t see beyond the
bushes.
</p><!--l. 121--><p class="indent" >   I saw them kill my husband, and could hardly contain a scream
myself, they had dragged him out and stabbed him in the stomach. I hid
behind the bushes and held my little one. They looted for but a
short time, as we didn&#8217;t have much. Then they set fire to my
home.
</p><!--l. 126--><p class="indent" >   My world went up in those flames. I was destroyed, my whole life
bankrupt. I still had my little one. When she found out, she cried, and I
cried with her.

<!--l. 311--><p class="noindent" >When I incarnated in the later 1600&#8217;s it was to a poor family in Southern
England. When I was still a boy my father didn&#8217;t come home one day,
and that was that. I was raised by my mother and sister, we went to
church on a regular basis.
</p><!--l. 313--><p class="indent" >   The preacher he often spoke of the pirates, as we were in a port town.
He said that they were all going to hell, and were destined to be there,
becoming demons, and living lives of endless torment. Not tormenting
just themselves mind you, but also the living, for the manifestations of
Satan were everywhere.
</p><!--l. 318--><p class="indent" >   Note that during this time, the living conditions of the impoverished
such as myself were rather attrocious. We lived in constant fear, with no
man of the house, any drunk could barge in, steal, beat and rape. The
police or men of authority were no better of course. Minor transgressions
could lead to floggings, or imprisonment. The rovings gangs only added
to the fear. There was no sympathy for the poor, much as is the case
today in many areas.
</p><!--l. 320--><p class="indent" >   The preacher spoke of heaven as a place where we could go and
worship God forever. I was already familiar with a life of submission, and
it did not seem appetizing to me.
</p><!--l. 324--><p class="indent" >   So I hope you understand the allure I felt, to be free of the fear that
at any moment I might be taken away, and not come home, for a minor
transgression. To become an immortal tormenting demon, seemed a
much safer bet. So when I came of age, I said my farewells to my
mother and sister, and joined a merchant vessel destined for the
Caribbean.
</p><!--l. 330--><p class="indent" >   I&#8217;m not sure when it happened but we were boarded by a military
vessel at some point. It was looking for stowaways and to warn us about
unsanctioned pirate activity in the area. For a hefty sum they said they
would accompany us.
</p><!--l. 332--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;With sums that high, this might as well be a robbery.&#8221; The
merchant owner replied.
</p><!--l. 334--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Better to lose some money than your life.&#8221;
</p><!--l. 336--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;I&#8217;ll take my chances.&#8221;
</p><!--l. 338--><p class="indent" >   The military people seemed unhappy, but the merchant was
                                                        
                                                        
unyielding. We got to port safely, which only solidified the merchants
decision, so he never paid protection. Eventually though, we did get
boarded. The stingy merchant also only paid pennies to the crew,
including myself, little more than a cabin boy.
</p><!--l. 340--><p class="indent" >   The first time we were boarded by pirates, they took our gold and
finery, then did a little recruiting. When I stepped up they laughed at
me saying they don&#8217;t accept boys, after they left I was flogged
for trying to join them. Couldn&#8217;t sleep comfortably for weeks
after.
</p><!--l. 342--><p class="indent" >   Eventually I joined another merchant vessel as a sailing hand, though
I was paid little more, I grew strong on the ropes. When next we were
boarded, I got in.
</p><!--l. 344--><p class="indent" >   Gambling is something I can only feed disgust and contempt for. I
didn&#8217;t understand my urges, and so prostitutes didn&#8217;t appeal to me.
Combined with my paranoia that I would get picked up and wouldn&#8217;t
come back, kept me within sight of the boat at all times. Preferably on
the boat. I never did like leaving it.
</p><!--l. 350--><p class="indent" >   I did acquire a taste for gold and jewels, the symbols of power I was
raised to hoard and admire as an impoverished child. Whether and
where I buried any of it is hard to say, and in any case it would likely be
underwater now, as I wouldn&#8217;t have gone beyond sight of our
modest schooner. I did buy some things for the boat, and was
in charge of resupplying it. Much did go to drink, as I was an
alcoholic.
</p><!--l. 352--><p class="indent" >   Eventually, the former leaders went missing on land or were killed
during our raids, so I was elected Captain. There were whispers that the
war was ending, and peace terms were to be signed. The maps
ended below cape horn. When I asked someone, they told me
dragons were there, loaded with gold, and the only reason it wasn&#8217;t
marked on the map, was that no one returned alive, all sorts of
strange tales. I valued my freedom and feared that an end to
the war would spell our end as well. So I decided that we should
continue south, along the coast of South America, ahead of the
news of impending end, propelled by the promise of boundless
riches.
                                                        
                                                        
</p><!--l. 354--><p class="indent" >   When passed the cape of south America and continued on south.
Luckily for us, it was summer in the southern hemisphere. We passed
some islands, devoid of dragons, but with some birds and seals.
We weren&#8217;t familiar with seals, but they tasted fine, and so we
kept going. Dragons that fed on such beasts would certainly be
enormous.
</p><!--l. 356--><p class="indent" >   We got to the Antarctic Peninsula, it was getting rather frigid. Nor
did the crew like the twilight of the endless day. While they were arguing
aboard, I went with a few of my more loyal crew to investigate the
land of dragons. I was in no rush to get back, it was all on the
verge of mutiny, and if I didn&#8217;t deliver, I&#8217;d probably be marooned
anyhow.
</p><!--l. 359--><p class="indent" >   So we continued on up the mountainside and through the valley. We
were mighty cold for a long time, as the little fingers on my left
hand had gone numb and turned black. It was then, in valley of a
frozen land, that I prayed. Not for salvation or redemption no, I
prayed for the fires of hell, for the demons to rise up and take me
there.
</p><!--l. 361--><p class="indent" >   They heard my call, for it was not much later we saw a flying
dragon. A bright light in the sky descending upon us. I awoke on
a hard metal bed, my little left fingers were missing, my crew
mates slept on beds beside me, and our clothes were on the floor
nearby, a cutlass glinting through them. Then I saw the little
demons, grey with their big black demonic eyes. I grabbed for my
cutlass and striked. &#8220;Take me to your jewels demon!&#8221; I said, while
running him through. It was my last conscious memory from that
lifetime.

 id="x1-13000042"></a>approximately 1740CE, Blue miner</h2>
<!--l. 379--><p class="noindent" >I reincarnated as a bluish reptilian-grey hybrid miner, deep in the warm
caves, to help me learn the value of minerals.
</p><!--l. 382--><p class="indent" >   My mining work was most of an exploratory nature. Over the
long time the Greys have been at that location there were a large
number of mines and tunnels dug. However the mineral and gem
requirements change over time, so I was mostly exploring old
tunnels to see if any could meet current requirements. When I found
some, I would bring a sample to a geologist, to get a sample I
needed the pick axe. If the geologist liked what he saw, then he&#8217;d
organize a work party with their large machines to excavate the
tunnel.
</p><!--l. 390--><p class="indent" >   I attended once to see what it was like, but there wasn&#8217;t much to see,
as the machine filled up most of the tunnel, couldn&#8217;t see where it
actually dug, so can&#8217;t really tell you if it was laser or what not. After
watching it for a while I got bored and went back to exploring more
tunnels. The exploratory mining host body I had, was &#8220;blessed&#8221; or
designed with a good navigational sense, so I didn&#8217;t need to use maps,
and could accurately describe the tunnel location where I found some
samples.
</p><!--l. 399--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;What is a unique experience from this lifetime?&#8221;
</p><!--l. 401--><p class="indent" >   As a miner I once found a shiny enough surface that I could see
myself in it. I had a big mouth and sharp teeth, and blueish skin. It was
when I realized I wasn&#8217;t like the Greys that stayed in the dome habitat
most of the time. That moment led to a series of events that eventually
led to my death &#8212; my fault really.
</p><!--l. 403--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;reptilian race inhabiting human form such as the queen of England
and other famous people, Is this true? They live among us in human
form? &#8221;
</p><!--l. 405--><p class="indent" >   I think most of that is simply disinformation &#8212; in terms of physically
reptilian hominids using holograms or otherwise pretending to be famous
homo-sapiens.
</p><!--l. 409--><p class="indent" >   I think that it may stem from a basic misunderstanding of royal
family lineages. According to various sources such as the Law of One,
                                                        
                                                        
Anak (AKA annunaki) (gods) came down to earth and reproduced with
homo-sapiens to make an elite (demi-gods), around 3600&#8211;3000 years ago
&#8212; I think the year system made it confusing for Ra, so it might actually
be 4,600&#8211;4000 years ago (2,600BCE&#8211;2,000BCE). That would put it
coincident with Enmebaragesi.
</p><!--l. 416--><p class="indent" >   Whether the anak bloodline is &#8220;reptilian&#8221;, doesn&#8217;t really matter, point
being is that it is was made to be elite. So the royal family, has been
attempting to preserve this bloodline, though obviously inbreeding and
non-anak bloodlines have led to problems.
</p><!--l. 421--><p class="indent" >   The other method in which someone that was a former &#8220;reptilian&#8221;
could be in human form, is if they are a wanderer, from a reptilian
planet/civilization, and incarnate as a human (such as myself).
</p><!--l. 425--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;What was your species called as a miner?&#8221;
</p><!--l. 427--><p class="indent" >   Names aren&#8217;t really important to Greys, instead our &#8220;names&#8221; are
based on our functional roles. For instance as a miner I was refered
to as &#8220;exploratory miner&#8221;, and as a geneticist, first I was called
&#8220;junior geneticist&#8221; then &#8220;junior surgeon&#8221;, and as a kidnapped I
was &#8220;second to the left&#8221; (as a reference to my place in the squad
formation).
</p><!--l. 434--><p class="indent" >   This makes it much less emotional when someone dies, also makes it
easier to replace them.
</p><!--l. 439--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;What do you think about humanities technological advancements?
What are some similarities to the greys technology and what are some
stark differences?&#8221;
</p><!--l. 441--><p class="indent" >   Similarities, well there are some similarities in the mining
technologies, for instance the use of helmets.
</p><!--l. 444--><p class="indent" >   Differences, well one of the major differences is information
technology. Since Greys have larger brain to body ratio&#8217;s, with a
large amount dedicated to telepathy, they don&#8217;t need to have
external devices as brain extensions. Homo-sapiens don&#8217;t have
telepathy, so rely on the internet, and news, and other forms of
external information transfer, much more heavily than Greys. I
think that is really one of the strong points of homo-sapiens, and
makes us a great candidate for creating fully robotic bodies for
incarnation.
                                                        
                                                        
</p><!--l. 452--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Do Greys have teeth?&#8221;
</p><!--l. 454--><p class="indent" >   The core models do not, though some hybrid ones do. In any case
they aren&#8217;t used since the food is mostly in gel form.
</p><!--l. 457--><p class="indent" >   For instance I had teeth as a exploratory miner, mostly used for
testing the hardness of various rocks. I also ate the gel, unlike others I
could fit large amounts in my belly, so could go for a long time, such as
weeks between meals. Of course I was cold-blooded, and didn&#8217;t sweat
so didn&#8217;t need nearly as much food or water as warm blooded
mammals.

 id="x1-13100043"></a>approximately 1780CE, Grey geneticists</h2>
</p><!--l. 466--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;What was childhood like as a Grey?&#8221;
</p><!--l. 468--><p class="indent" >   well first attained consciousness in the sac, the nurses would send
soothing messages to us that we were needed and wanted to motivate us
to continue growing.
</p><!--l. 472--><p class="indent" >   After body developed in sac it opened and I was flushed out onto the
floor, I then got up and walked &#8212; many animals walk at birth, it mostly
is dependant on room in the sac (which is insufficiently large in
homo-sapiens for a baby to spend 18&#8211;24 months reaching physical
maturity). I know there are cases of people witnessing &#8220;baby greys&#8221;, but
these are usually hybrids, or if there is something wrong a fetus can be
removed from the sac. After birth there was a relatively short communal
experience together (perhaps a few months), for orientation and fitness
testing.
</p><!--l. 481--><p class="indent" >   Then our role mentors would show up and we would learn
on the job. Homo sapiens are capable of similar path and for a
long time it was the case when jobs were inherited. I know my
son since he was about two has wanted to do everything I do
himself.
</p><!--l. 487--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;What is a unique experience from this lifetime?&#8221;
</p><!--l. 489--><p class="indent" >   In terms of the geneticist, the most unique experience, was an &#8220;orgy&#8221;
that I attended. We used a special hallucinogenic gel, and rolled around
in it together and ontop of each other. Being telepathic we really merged
minds quite strongly, and it was hard to differentiate where one of
us started, and another one ended. It was a very deep bonding
experience.
</p><!--l. 495--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Do you guys talk to each other, or use telepathic communications?&#8221;
</p><!--l. 497--><p class="indent" >   telepathy, though body language and touch can play a role for more
personal exchanges.
</p><!--l. 499--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Are you aware of any other species of aliens?&#8221;
</p><!--l. 502--><p class="indent" >   Greys are more of a biological family, there are many species of
Grey.
</p><!--l. 504--><p class="indent" >   Though Greys have hybridized with many sentient organisms over
the many light years and millions of years of their domains.
                                                        
                                                        
</p><!--l. 507--><p class="indent" >   So yes there are plenty of other sentient species
</p><!--l. 509--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;idea that the Greys are future descendants of modern humans?
&#8221;
</p><!--l. 511--><p class="indent" >   Well that is certainly an option, hybridization programs are in place,
so in future many homo-sapiens may converge with Greys.
</p><!--l. 514--><p class="indent" >   Though as I previously mentioned it would be ideal to maintain a
natural homo-sapien population for adaptive capacity.
</p><!--l. 519--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;did homo-sapiens evolve from earlier hominids or were we genetically
modified?&#8221;
</p><!--l. 521--><p class="indent" >   You might like Ra&#8217;s law of one 18:14
</p><!--l. 523--><p class="indent" >   He talks about how there was genetic modifications about 75,000
years ago by Yahweh (introducing group-think), and again around
3,600&#8211;3,000 years ago (by Anuk the Sumerians, and likely ancient
Egyptians, introducing elites).
</p><!--l. 527--><p class="indent" >   Unfortunately the people questioning Ra in the 80&#8217;s weren&#8217;t aware of
Greys, though it seems Yahweh is the best match. Greys do generally
live lives without sin, as they aren&#8217;t actually able to have sex (lacking
genitals), nor be gluttons (ingest gel through skin), don&#8217;t have any
vanity, as generally lack any clothing or personal possessions, don&#8217;t have
sloth since always have something to do &#8212; only possessions are work
related.
</p><!--l. 534--><p class="indent" >   Also in terms of making homo-sapiens the image of the Greys,
one of the notable features is the forehead, and softer features.
Homo erectus, had a receding forehead and very pronounced facial
features. Whereas homo-sapiens have high foreheads and fairly flat
faces.
</p><!--l. 539--><p class="indent" >   The Grey Aliens, I wouldn&#8217;t say created, I&#8217;d say more interfered with
by reptilians. Greys are hybrids by nature, as I was mentioning, due to
intense nuclear and ecological devastation of their home planet they
had to move underground, where they had many problems with
reproduction, so had to resort to cloning. Both for controlling the
amount and types of bodies which were produced &#8212; to maximize
efficiency of the hive.
</p><!--l. 546--><p class="indent" >   Many underground organisms follow such behaviour, including wasps,
bees, moles, ants. It&#8217;s something about being underground that makes it
                                                        
                                                        
the most effective way of being.
</p><!--l. 550--><p class="indent" >   The Greys being hybrids have interacted with both Reptilian and
Mammalian civilizations. Though generally Greys are considered
&#8220;reptilian&#8221; because they have a tendency towards being cold-blooded,
living in passive-heated caves, means they don&#8217;t need to waste calories
on maintaining body temperature.
</p><!--l. 556--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;How did the greys create more greys before the invention/discovery
of gene splicing?&#8221;
</p><!--l. 558--><p class="indent" >   well the story goes, that a long time ago, in a solar system far away,
possibly Zeta Reticuli, Greys reproduced normally. But then either due
to some kind of interference or nuclear war, they were forced to move
underground. At that point they already had gene splicing, so that is
when the Greys were first developed.
</p><!--l. 565--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;So are there still only two genders with grey aliens? How important
is gender to that race and do they adhere to the same gender roles as
humans to?&#8221;
</p><!--l. 567--><p class="indent" >   Genetically speaking there are only two genders.
</p><!--l. 569--><p class="indent" >   Though realistically there are many different models, each specialized
for a particular purpose/job in the hive. So all of these &#8220;genders&#8221; are
necessary in order to successfully reproduce.
</p><!--l. 573--><p class="indent" >   There typically aren&#8217;t a great variety within a model. So for instance
for a geneticist, there were only females as far as I can recall, we were all
pretty closely related, since we were pretty much the same model with
some minor tweaks and mutations.
</p><!--l. 578--><p class="indent" >   Similarly all the qualified surgeons were female, because female
brains have better fine motor skills. Again it wasn&#8217;t that only females
were &#8220;chosen&#8221; for the job, it is that the surgeon model, happened to be
female. The exploratory mining models were male, as male brains have
better navigational memory, and this was enhanced for that model. For
instance even though I travelled through vast arrays of tunnels,
sometimes for as long as a week at a time. A almost never had any
trouble finding my way back &#8212; unless there was some collapse or detour.
And could always accurately explain where I got a particular
sample.
</p><!--l. 587--><p class="indent" >   I think there may have been some female miners, which were
                                                        
                                                        
specially designated for detail work.
</p><!--l. 590--><p class="indent" >   So even within a more broad profession (miner) there could be
models which were a different gender.
</p><!--l. 593--><p class="indent" >   There isn&#8217;t however any &#8220;gender-inequality&#8221;, or &#8220;class conflict&#8221;, since
all the various roles are required for the continued health and
reproduction of the hive.
</p><!--l. 597--><p class="indent" >   In my first life as a miner, at some point I felt inferior, but really it
was all just in my head, no one treated me with anything but
respect.
     </p><div class="quote">
     <!--l. 605--><p class="noindent" >What do you mean by models? Are there any transgender
     greys and does anybody experience gender dysphoria?
     Some   people   say   that   humans   experience   gender
     dysphoria because they have bleed-through feelings from
     their  previous  lives  as  say  male,  so  that  when  they
     incarnate as female they feel as though they should be
     male and it&#8217;s painful to them. Any of this relevant to the
     greys?</p></div>
<!--l. 607--><p class="indent" >   models, like how there are different robot models, for instance a
vacuum Roomba, a mopping Roomba, a sweeping Roomba.
</p><!--l. 610--><p class="indent" >   Transgender Greys? Well for the core-models there is no reproductive
morphology, so it is impossible to be &#8220;trans-gender&#8221;, there is almost no
way of differentiating male and female externally.
</p><!--l. 614--><p class="indent" >   Some of the homo-sapien grey hybrids, which are being bred as
ambassadors may have genitals, and may engage in various habits which
are more common amongst homo-sapiens, like wearing clothes, or having
hair and combing it. Yes, I&#8217;ve heard the &#8220;incarnation bleed-through&#8221;
theories as well, they seem to be extremely prevalent, so perhaps that is
how it is for at least some people.
</p><!--l. 620--><p class="indent" >   For the Greys, I have limited experience, but I did have job
dysphoria, at some point the genetics research was so terribly difficult,
and my successes few and far in between, so I asked if perhaps I wasn&#8217;t
cut out for the job. I remember visiting somewhat of an old wise
                                                        
                                                        
counselor type person. He said it wasn&#8217;t unusual for a first incarnation
in the genetics field to have a lot of difficulty, but did allow me
to move to a different facet of the process, the gene extraction
or surgery component. I found it to be much easier, as it was
much more, similar to my previous life as a miner, where I had
an objective (a gene sample) and a maze (a body) from which I
had to extract it. I remember practicing on smallish rodent, by
getting the stem cells located in the middle of their abdomen. It
was once I had been doing that for a while that I learned about
the kidnapper Grays, who would source the creatures from the
surface. I had some opportunities to go on missions as a surgeon as
well.
</p><!--l. 634--><p class="indent" >   Why I chose to incarnate as a human is because this is a time
of great change, and my mission is to help create a robot or AI
genus of bodies for incarnation. That way can colonize planets
and eco-regions not accessible to liquid bodies like the Greys and
homo-sapiens.
     </p><div class="quote">
     <!--l. 645--><p class="noindent" >Also  I  was  wondering  if  you  were  aware  of  why  you
     chose to incarnate as a human after those lifetimes as a
     grey and how has your understanding of your previous
     incarnations affected the way you feel about your life
     now?
     </p><!--l. 645--><p class="noindent" >Oh  and  how  far  down  are  the  greys  and  is  there  a
     widespread rule that they are not allowed to interfere
     with us to such a level that they would become widely
     known to us? If so, for what purpose is that?.</p></div>
<!--l. 647--><p class="indent" >   How has my understanding of previous lives affected how I feel about
my life now? It has given me a lot of purpose and drive in some respects,
in others it has greatly humbled me, and made me cautious to avoid
mistakes I&#8217;ve made in the past.
</p><!--l. 652--><p class="indent" >   The greys are far down enough to be at a comfortable temperature.
                                                        
                                                        
So as far as I understand about 1&#8211;4km on earth, and 15+km on mars.
Not sure what the set-up is on Ganymede and Callisto, though
presumably on Europa there is access to the rocky lithosphere at the
bottom of the ocean, at reasonable enough pressures to be able to make
rock domes and such.
</p><!--l. 658--><p class="indent" >   There is a widespread rule, called the golden rule. Basically if the
Greys interfere with homo-sapiens then that increases the risk of
homo-sapiens interfering with the Greys. In terms of becoming widely
known, there isn&#8217;t really any benefit to the Greys to have homo-sapiens
aware of their activities. Part of the veil of forgetting, or the veil of
confusion/ignorance, is to allow people to believe what they want to
believe, to allow a greater diversity of thought.
</p><!--l. 666--><p class="indent" >   Homo-sapiens may create something new, but if the knowledge
spheres of Greys publicly meet, then there will be a bunch of things that
wont be made anew, since they are already available. For instance Elon
Musk is making rockets to travel to Mars, and has all these fancy ideas
about how we&#8217;ll be the first people there. Those kind of ambitions would
seem completely silly and reinventing of the wheel if Greys were
publicly acknowledged. For me personally robot bodies are of
interest,
</p><!--l. 674--><p class="indent" >   homo-sapiens don&#8217;t have the cultural baggage of past failed attempts
in this galaxy, so can make them with the same kind of vigour that Elon
Musk is making his rockets.
</p><!--l. 678--><p class="indent" >   For instance previous failures were due to them being primarily
military robots, so it is a good idea to instead have co-operative robots.
Personally I benefit from exposing the Greys, and the galactic history, as
it helps to explain why it is valuable for us to focus on making fully
robot host bodies, rather than reinventing the wheel of upgrading
biological bodies.

</p><!--l. 689--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;What is the most valuable piece of information you can give
us?&#8221;
</p><!--l. 691--><p class="indent" >   Valuable depends on what someone values it as.
</p><!--l. 693--><p class="indent" >   Greys have lots of valuable knowledge. Though in terms of
knowledge about them, I guess the most important is knowing
that there are billions of them in our solar system, they have
been defending the planet for millions of years, and are willing to
co-operate with homo-sapiens &#8212; even in this adolescent stage of
development.
</p><!--l. 700--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;What is a unique experience from this lifetime?&#8221;
</p><!--l. 702--><p class="indent" >   As an abductor/kidnapper. It was probably when the bullet ripped
through my chest. My centre, or the group leader, turned around
(perhaps mentally) stared at me, and said it was all my fault, that I did
this to myself. I wanted it all along. That I didn&#8217;t have to involve them
in this mess. At which point I lost consciousness, and left my body. As I
was floating over my dead body, I felt him &#8220;curse&#8221;, and then organize a
full mental assault on the gunman, they had him down and unconscious
in seconds. Clearly they didn&#8217;t need my help, so I went back to the soul
world.
</p><!--l. 713--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;I do not respect the souls of kidnappers and rapists, I am glad you
will join us in the suffering that your &#8220;people&#8221; helped create. I wish I was
the one to bring about your death&#8221;
</p><!--l. 715--><p class="indent" >   Wow, that is pretty harsh stuff. As I&#8217;ve stated, while I did help by
lending my mind for soothing energies, I didn&#8217;t actually physically
kidnap or &#8220;rape&#8221; anyone &#8212; even though I was in a group of those that
did kidnap and do surgery.
