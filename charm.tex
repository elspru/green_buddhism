\section{Casting}

Do you cast spells for others to find lovers too?

Logan Streondj, [01.12.17 08:44]
[In reply to ZG]
That would damage my polarization. 
I rather teach a man to fish. 
It is more useful for me for you to be confident in you casting abilities,
than it is for you to be confident in mine.

ZG, [01.12.17 08:45]
Haha, I was thinking about me for a friend :)

Logan Streondj, [01.12.17 08:53]
[In reply to ZG]
lol, I'm not sure what that means.

At most I usually give a blessing, such as may your magic bear good fruit.

ZG, [01.12.17 08:55]
I was considering doing what you preferred not doing for a friend than asking
you to do it for me :).

In some odd ways I may care less who actually does things than whether they
happen or not ;)

Logan Streondj, [01.12.17 09:03]
[In reply to ZG]
In this case, I would recommend you cast it for yourself and succeed, then teach
your friend how to cast.
Alternatively you can ask them to join you on your casting journey,  and you
would both learn to cast together. 
I am certainly available for helping with explaining the casting and
follow-through process.

ZG, [01.12.17 11:06]
Hmm, you can't integrate casting simply into your mode of being?

Logan Streondj, [01.12.17 12:59]
That's like saying, can I reap the benefits of meditation, without sitting down
for meditation.
While 24 hour vipassanna is possible, it is an advanced skill, that comes after
years of practicing more traditional forms of meditation.

Logan Streondj, [01.12.17 13:01]
Basically how the hierarchy of meditation goes, 
is a thought is the weakest spell,
then something that is spoken, 
then something that is saved on hard-drive,

Logan Streondj, [01.12.17 13:01]
just like with sitting down for meditation, have to sit down and write out a
magic spell, or what it is that you want.

ZG, [01.12.17 13:02]
[In reply to Logan Streondj]
Seems it can happen, albeit quite rarely. Then again, one meditates for when one
is not meditating.

ZG, [01.12.17 13:02]
And what if your thought is one such that it is etched in memory clearly and
solidly?

ZG, [01.12.17 13:03]
Hmm, with my gf/babymomma, it was not just in diary/chats but the idea in
conversation with people too.

Logan Streondj, [01.12.17 13:04]
well our brains are bags of water, oil and electricity, they can store stuff
sure.

The general formula is that the more of the galaxy cosmos the spell-seed
affects, the more powerful it is.

Logan Streondj, [01.12.17 13:05]
Yes, so sharing it with friends, increases the amount of the galaxy cosmos that
it affects, since they hold it also.

Logan Streondj, [01.12.17 13:06]
like if you write a spell on a slip of paper, and then burn it outside,  it goes
up into the atmosphere.  You can expect speedy though possibly transient
results.  I'd only do it for something fairly minor.

ZG, [01.12.17 13:06]
Hmm, reminds me of what this guy suggests... quite similar:
https://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2012/10/shameless-fearless-guiltless/

ZG, [01.12.17 13:08]
[In reply to Logan Streondj]
cuz it gets out into the cosmos... but not into any stable system

ZG, [01.12.17 13:09]
Hmm, it sounds like the process of writing out clearly what one wants, etching
this into one's thoughts, and telling people... can become simply a part of
one's mode of being.

Advising visualizing in as much visceral clarity as possible :0

Logan Streondj, [01.12.17 13:11]
[In reply to ZG]
good one yes.   if he refers to internal critics, those may be tulpas,  they can
assuaged through love and integration, be not many but one.

Logan Streondj, [01.12.17 13:12]
[In reply to ZG]
Yes certainly, it is habit forming, much like meditation and computer
programming.

Logan Streondj, [01.12.17 13:14]
[In reply to Logan Streondj]
though one of those may be a spirit guide,  can only know through testing and
verification.

ZG, [01.12.17 13:15]
[In reply to Logan Streondj]
internal critics... not fully sure if only those. 

His world view is a bit weird but I've found him inspirational :)

ZG, [01.12.17 13:16]
[In reply to Logan Streondj]
Meaning the answer is yes, but jumping there without intentional practice may be
harder.

Logan Streondj, [01.12.17 16:44]
[In reply to ZG]
If you mean that you can avoid casting spells, then no.  I often am casting
spells.   Like for instance now that I think about it, I did make a spell for
the business, as I sent in an email to the linux users mailing list for the
meetup where I met the former business  owner, saying how I had great respect
for him and his business, and it was a great business to be in.
Also when he said he was retiring his business a couple of months later, I told
him I could take up from him. 

The "vipassana" portion of it, is maintaining awareness of the mindstream. So
there were several times in my mind where I was posed the hypothetical scenario
of having a similar business, and I said that I liked it.  That likely allowed
the magic to progress.

ZG, [02.12.17 06:01]
One could see that as a normal action: letting someone know you respect their
business and wouldn't mind doing it. One could read it as a hint.

To that degree, can you distinguish spell casting from basically effective
action? 

In which case, yes, it can be done as a part of basic life :-)

Logan Streondj, [02.12.17 07:37]
well meditation can be done as part of basic life as well,
can simply be integrated into your routine.

The idea with magic is that you have to be aware of all the things you do, say
and think,
to make sure they align with your goals.   

This extends to various aphorisms, like instead of saying "don't forget", I
always say "please remember".
It can take some practice but all negative speech (using not's) can be turned
into positive speech, using the direct word that is required.

The only times it is then approrpiate to use not's is as a euphamism, and to
avoid "bad" words.
Like instead of cursing someone by telling them all the horrible things that
will happen to them if the continue doing something,
can say "that's not healthy and safe, how about doing this healthier and safer
thing instead?"

ZG, [02.12.17 08:11]
Putting meditation into your routine  is still having meditation as some
separate event :/. I've done that a lot, but :P.

How what you say differens from self-coherence and positivty, it's not that
clear. Sounds like being self-coherent and outgoingly positive, magic will be
cast... whether you're aware of it or not :)

ZG, [02.12.17 08:27]
[In reply to Logan Streondj]
Hmm, this would indicate saving my coherent desires in Google Drive or
publishing on Facebook/Twitter will help the Cosmos help me more than just
saving it on my laptop (unless i'm infected by botnets sharing my diary)

Logan Streondj, [02.12.17 09:09]
[In reply to ZG]
Yes it might.  Though I'd also recommend printing it out.  As even saved on a
google drive, it only affects a small number of molecules. 
wheras something that is printed affects a lot more.

ZG, [02.12.17 09:16]
So making posters to stick up around the city with my wishes for myself and
others :D

So this casting in large part is detailing what you want, sharing, and having
coherent clarity on it... :)?

Logan Streondj, [02.12.17 09:16]
yes

\section{Curses and Responsibility}
ZG, [03.12.17 04:19]
[In reply to Logan Streondj]
Hmm, this type of magic would imply that you can also curse people, huh.

Logan Streondj, [03.12.17 08:39]
yes, though "karma's a bitch". and technically there is no reason to ever curse
or be angry with anyone,

Logan Streondj, [03.12.17 08:39]
because to blame another, is to take power from self and give it to other self.

ZG, [03.12.17 08:41]
we are interdependent. taking full credit yourself or giving full credit to
someone else... 

I suppose you could curse — or at least stint — people without intending it

ZG, [03.12.17 08:42]
As you said about how you are careful when telling people about themselves... as
that can easily get negative or project some defeatism

Logan Streondj, [03.12.17 08:54]
[In reply to ZG]
If you aspire to godhood, then you have to at take 95%+ responsibility for your
own experience.

In terms of unintentional curses,  many people do this, through a variety of
colloquialisms.  Such as "poor child", "don't forget", and a variety of other
pitiful statements are all curses.
It is important to learn to notice them, reprogram them, and also mention if you
notice anyone in your experience using them, so they can also be reprogrammed.

Logan Streondj, [03.12.17 08:57]
[In reply to ZG]
I'm not sure what you refer to that I said.  Though generally I don't spend a
lot of time thinking about other people or their motivtions, as making
assumptions in this regard is often wrong. 
Typically what happens if I do think someone has some ideas which are not wht I
wish, 
then I figure out what I would prefer them to think,  then I ask them what they
think.

ZG, [03.12.17 09:01]
=]. I suppose more likely than true curse is simply their spoken wish
conflicting with yours, resulting in nothing much.

I'm not sure about that 95%. Sounds like a type of over-distanced "godhood".

Logan Streondj, [03.12.17 09:01]
I'm not perfect though, as no one is. So I'm sure if you look hard enough you'll
find where I deviated from my own suggestions.
That is one of the benefits of having a group of people that are learning
together.  For instance sometimes I forget postiive speech, and my wife reminds
me, and vice versa. 
So if you notice me being "hypocritical" or anything please do mention it, so
that I can improve and be better.

ZG, [03.12.17 09:01]
[In reply to Logan Streondj]
Good of you to figure out what you would prefer first.

ZG, [03.12.17 09:01]
:)

Logan Streondj, [03.12.17 09:03]
explain what you mean by "over-distanced godhood", please.

ZG, [03.12.17 09:04]
[In reply to Logan Streondj]
Sure. Living according to one's philosophy is hard. 

I set out to do that for my new year's resolution, yet that can also come across
in quite a clear and precisely controlled manner. Whereas I've ended up in the
direction far from precise control, acting freely trusting myself to ultimately
cohere action and philosophy.

ZG, [03.12.17 09:07]
[In reply to Logan Streondj]
To me that sounds like the vision of living in essence independently from
others. When you can truly take 95%+ responsibility for your own experience,
does that also mean others plain and simply can't influence 95% of your world?
You're 95% solipsistic in your own reality?

I wonder to what degree you can let others deeply into your world and still take
near toatl responsibility — except in that you take responsibility for letting
them in or kicking them out?

Logan Streondj, [03.12.17 09:09]
the 95%+ number is from the law of one,  it is the basic requirement of how much
percentage of what you do is for yourself. 
If you take 95%+ responsibility for what is happening, then you have 95%+
control of it.  

It's not solipsistic,  rather imagine your experience as a bubble floating
through 11 dimensions.
By modifying your beliefs you change your location. Here I can explain with an
ankh.

Logan Streondj, [03.12.17 09:10]

Logan Streondj, [03.12.17 09:13]
your body is the red ball.  it is anchored with the white base of knowledge.
ahead of you is nothing or possibility.  you can change where you fly to using
choice (yellow) and by previewing it with your third-eye (blue), then modifying
knowledge to change your location.  technically I should also add green for
anchoring onto goals, and cyan for modifying knowledge.

Logan Streondj, [03.12.17 09:15]
so you are still a small speck in creation, 
and other people can still talk to you and have agency, they have their own
bubbles.
But you can shift along a dimension in order to experience a different version
of them.

Logan Streondj, [03.12.17 09:16]
shifting along a dimension has to do with tuning your vibration,
so that you float in the correct direction, like the multi-dimensional
swim-bladder I was talking about.

ZG, [03.12.17 09:18]
And what if you maneuver to some version of someone and then welcome and embrace
them into you... thus violating taht 95%, although you excercised that 95% in
finding them...

Logan Streondj, [03.12.17 09:19]
[In reply to ZG]
I'm not exactly sure what you mean by this.
could you rephrase?

Logan Streondj, [03.12.17 09:20]
I don't see how embracing someone would be a violation.

ZG, [03.12.17 09:28]
[In reply to Logan Streondj]
Hmm, maybe you're right. In many cases "take responsibility for your experience"
makes sense to me. Wouldn't put a number to it.

I suppose I meant that in giving someone the ability to affect you, you are
giving them some of this responsibility as well.

Logan Streondj, [03.12.17 09:29]
One caveat is that the dimensions are finite, as are people.  So pretty much
anywhere you float to while incarnated will still be in the galaxy cosmos. And
people are finite as well, while the dimensions give some variations,  outside a
certain area they may not be intersectable.

Logan Streondj, [03.12.17 09:32]
[In reply to ZG]
Even with allowing people to affect you, you can give a range of possibilities.
So for instance they can say a variety of things.  
I know my wife gets upset if I limit her too much,  so yeah have to allow for
certain range of expression where both of you feel comfortble.

Logan Streondj, [03.12.17 09:35]
Also by responsibility I don't mean absolute control over the situation, I mean
ability to respond to the situation.
If the situation goes in  a direction you don't like, then you are able to
steer.
Many people just take their hands off the wheels and allow themselves to become
a victim to a vehicle they refuse to steer.
Going into the nearest ditch, suffering damage, and all taking however long it
takes to heal.

Like I said with the bubble example, you have your vehicle,  you don't dictate
what happens on the road, but you can choose which road you drive on.

Logan Streondj, [03.12.17 09:35]
and how you drive on it.
