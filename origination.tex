\item In the begining there was nothing (Table~\ref{nothing}). Zero.
\item Then there was Not nothing. NOT the first activity. 
\item Afterwards there was not And nothing. AND the second activity.
\item Conditional activites appeared. 
\item The base cosmos grew more complex. 
\item Geometry developed. 
\item With shapes, there were enough bodies for social experience.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Soul World}\label{soulWorld}

The soul world is in the base cosmos, or close to it.
There we with you float around as balls of light in geometric forms ---
This is verifiable via life-between-lives regression
hypnotherapy\cite{newtins}\cite{newton2000destiny}

Eventually we with you got bored of floating around in base cosmos,
and decided to create new and more complex cosmos.
After some ``time'', we with you created the galaxy cosmos, where you are reading this
text.

When we with you reincarnate in this complex galaxy cosmos, just as when you are 
playing virtual computer sports, a part of you stays in one world, and a part
of you dips into another.

\section{Mission}\label{mission}

As with computer sports, there is often a mission to measure success.

\subsection{What is your private mission?}

We with you, in the soul world, with the help of our friends and professors,
 analyze our lives, and see where we can improve. Then we set those as various
purposes for reincarnating, so we with your private mission is educational.

\begin{itemize}
\item Do you remember what your purposes for reincarnation were?
\item Do you know what your private mission is?
\item Some theta-brainwave (from 4hz til 8hz) mind administration (meditation) can help you answer those
questions. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{What is our public mission?}

Our public mission, is to continue as our ancestors, that created the galaxy
world for more complex bodies and educational ecology.  


The mission of Green Buddhism, is to grow the number, diversity and complexity of bodies and
ecologies in the galaxy cosmos. 

If that is compatible with your private mission, or you can ration some time or
resources for
the public mission, we would love your help.

\subsection{Initial Steps}

To understand the initial steps, it is best to tell the history of this galaxy,
and it's neighbours.

Note that while much of the galaxy's history is public information, it is also
secret for various reasons. There is disinformation activity, to allow you to
have a more deep dip into your private mission, and living here on Earth.
