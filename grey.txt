[QUOTE=Baby Steps;1147484]Thanks for your answers.
The word 'domain' has featured.

Is Earth a grey 'domain' , and could you comment on whether you know of any other entities or groups claiming Domain on Earth?

Many thanks[/QUOTE]
 


[QUOTE=Did You See Them;1147489]You say there is no sex difference but keep referring to "female" greys - why ?[/QUOTE]
 
There is no external morphological difference, as there is no reproductive morphology. 
however it feels different being a male or a female, also male/female minds feel  different,
so for instance the males may be XY and the females XX just like humans, 
though externally the look pretty much identical -- no energy wasted on reproductive morphology..

Then I incarnated as a [B]female genetic engineer[/B], 
I participated in some food lathering orgies in my spare time. 
 
My first two life times I spent underground,

So... I am guessing that the "Gra/eys" are behind that gender-pronoun psy-op which switches from one to another on a whim :)[/QUOTE]
 
Yes, I'm the same person, though my memories have refined over time. 
The genders have stayed the same as you noted...


[QUOTE=OmeyocaN777;1147491]What can you tell us about A.I ultimate goal ?
The "mother" of the greys is a robot hive/expansion of an A.I control-program ?
Humans, reptilians, greys or most 4th dimensional beings are slaves of A.I (black goo) ?
What is the differences between this alien A.I and earth's A.I ?
Are we living in a prison planet and how can we escape ?
Do A.I exists in 5th dimension and beyond ?
Who is behind all religions and what is it purpose ?
How can we activate dna, third eye, "rainbow" body and is this the answer in human evolution or escaping A.I control ?
Is the sun's frequency changes and why ?
What do you know about alien implants in human bodies (i'm speaking about the malevolent ones) and how can we get rid of them ? 
Most of my questions are about A.I because i see that you are interesting in robot hives, manipulation of dna, control-life or believing that creator (love) don't exist.....and i want to better understand your philosophy or your intention...
Thank you in advance[/QUOTE]
 


[QUOTE=Feritciva;1147499]Hi Elspru,

Ok, many possibilities come to mind when seeing this thread for the first time - and probably they were all covered in ATS thread - linked in above posts. I guess this is a very good aspect of Avalon Forum, you may find cross-references for any subject/question you have in mind. 

So far I've read couple of pages on ATS and I see your approach as "an experiment in path of seeker". Very fine. Let's jump to the question wagon then! :)


- Have you ever tried Ayahuasca? Grandmother Aya showed me I'm from Orion in one of the sessions I attended. What's your info on Orion? I don't know why but I've always seen Orion as "dark side". Probably Orion is a vast place and it has a mixed population. What do u think?[/QUOTE]
 

[QUOTE=Justplain;1147512]Well, Elspru, this is an interesting thread.  You asked me to clarify what the question was regarding that "grays are not held in high esteem here".  Like i said, Grays are disliked here, they are considered to be violaters of fundamental rights, of stealing from disapproving victims.  You may retort that humans treat animals the same way, but that does not justify Grays treatment of humans, imho.

From my readings, i understand Earth is considered to be a difficult soul school, but a highly regarded one, especially because it emphasizes individual responsibility and free choice.  

To my understanding, the Gray collective ('hive' in your terminology), is an extremely inferior incarnation vehicle.  It doesnt seem to provide the growth in spirit that humans have.  The star sytems that have species with free choice i hear include the Pliaedes and Arcturians.  

So, although i find it interesting some of the info you've shared, i still dont like Greys, even if they supposedly have souls.  This may be considered a value judgement, but i find their 'culture' to be inferior, and their treatment of humans as uncivilized, much like the human illuminati.

Also, i see no great value in having robot hosts for souls, apparently we can see or do anything a robot can do psychically, if we really want to.  

I want to explore my higher spirit, and the higher realms.  And there IS UNIVERSAL LOVE and there is COSMIC CONSCIOUSNESS.  I cant see the greys, in the conditions you describe, as ever attaining or experiencing either.[/QUOTE]
 


[QUOTE=YoYoYo;1147515]Hello elspru. I have a question I want to ask even though I'm still on the fence and please this is with respect I am enjoying this thread but have not made up my mind if I accept your truth.. even though I do believe you are being sincere in what you say. 

But this is the question I want to ask aliens!!

Do aliens play and enjoy music in anyway that is comparable to our paradigm?

Thank you

[QUOTE=araucaria;1147517][QUOTE=elspru;1147475]nope, I probably talk too much, lol.[/QUOTE]
This is very much not what I am getting. You joined the forum seven years ago, when there was little or no vetting of membership applications. Since 3rd June 2010 we hadn’t heard a squeak out of you until now. I’d be interested to know what triggered this sudden bout of loquacity.[/QUOTE]
 


[QUOTE=devplan;1147534]Hi elspru

Whats the gray's relation and importance in regards to [B]duality[/B] and war vs. piece?
And what is the gray's attitude toward [B]sovereignty[/B] of other beings?
What is your view on the role of archons?

Please elaborate. Tks.[/QUOTE]
